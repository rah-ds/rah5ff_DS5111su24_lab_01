### Lab 1 Makefiles, Linux, Bash

This lab uses project [Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1065)
to load and analyze books that no longer have Copyrights. 

Being UVa, we naturally care about Edgar Allan Poe.

The makefile downloads and runs analysis on two different sets of data.

1) On the famous `Raven` Poem
2) On another 10 works selected.

The 10 works in question are:

* [The Bells and other Poems](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/50852/pg50852.txt)
* [The Cask of Amontillado](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1063/pg1063.txt)
* [The Masque of the Red Death](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1064/pg1064.txt)
* [Eureka: A Prose Poem](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/32037/pg32037.txt)
* [Lords of the Housetops: Thirteen Cat Tales](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/30092/pg30092.txt)
* [Selections from Poe](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8893/pg8893.txt)
* [The Fall of the House of Usher](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/932/pg932.txt)
* [Famous Modern Ghost Stories](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/15143/pg15143.txt)
* [The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/51060/pg51060.txt)
* [The Best American Humorous Short Stories](https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10947/pg10947.txt)

I think some of these might contain the Raven Poem  I got what I could!
