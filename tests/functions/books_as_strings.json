Tietze._The secret of the Sphinx.                        _R. Staudenbaur._COMMENT ON THE POEM.The secret of a poem, no less than a jest's prosperity, lies in the ear ofhim that hears it. Yield to its spell, accept the poet's mood: this, afterall, is what the sages answer when you ask them of its value. Even thoughthe poet himself, in his other mood, tell you that his art is but sleightof hand, his food enchanter's food, and offer to show you the trick ofit,--believe him not. Wait for his prophetic hour; then give yourself tohis passion, his joy or pain. \"We are in Love's hand to-day!\" singsGautier, in Swinburne's buoyant paraphrase,--and from morn to sunset we arewafted on the violent sea: there is but one love, one May, one flowerystrand. Love is eternal, all else unreal and put aside. The vision has anend, the scene changes; but we have gained something, the memory of acharm. As many poets, so many charms. There is the charm of Evanescence,that which lends to supreme beauty and grace an aureole of Pathos. Sharewith Landor his one \"night of memories and of sighs\" for Rose Aylmer, andyou have this to the full.And now take the hand of a new-world minstrel, strayed from some properhabitat to that rude and dissonant America which, as Baudelaire saw, \"wasfor Poe only a vast prison through which he ran, hither and thither, withthe feverish agitation of a being created to breathe in a purer world,\" andwhere \"his interior life, spiritual as a poet, spiritual even as adrunkard, was but one perpetual effort to escape the influence of thisantipathetical atmosphere.\" Clasp the sensitive hand of a troubled singerdreeing thus his weird, and share with him the clime in which hefound,--never throughout the day, always in the night,--if not the Atlantiswhence he had wandered, at least a place of refuge from the bounds in whichby day he was immured.To one land only he has power to lead you, and for one night only can youshare his dream. A tract of neither Earth nor Heaven: \"No-man's-land,\" outof Space, out of Time. Here are the perturbed ones, through whose eyes,like those of the Cenci, the soul finds windows though the mind is dazed;here spirits, groping for the path which leads to Eternity, are halted anddelayed. It is the limbo of \"planetary souls,\" wherein are all moonlightuncertainties, all lost loves and illusions. Here some are fixed in trance,the only respite attainable; others         \"move fantastically    To a discordant melody:\"while everywhere are    \"Sheeted Memories of the Past--    Shrouded forms that start and sigh    As they pass the wanderer by.\"Such is the land, and for one night we enter it,--a night of astral phasesand recurrent chimes. Its monodies are twelve poems, whose music strives tochange yet ever is the same. One by one they sound, like the chiming of thebrazen and ebony clock, in \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" which made thewaltzers pause with \"disconcert and tremulousness and meditation,\" as oftenas the hour came round.Of all these mystical cadences, the plaint of _The Raven_, vibratingthrough the portal, chiefly has impressed the outer world. What things goto the making of a poem,--and how true in this, as in most else, that racewhich named its bards \"the makers\"? A work is called out of the void. Wherethere was nothing, it remains,--a new creation, part of the treasure ofmankind. And a few exceptional lyrics, more than others that are equallycreative, compel us to think anew how bravely the poet's pen turns thingsunknown          \"to shapes, and gives to airy nothing    A local habitation, and a name.\"Each seems without a prototype, yet all fascinate us with elements wrestedfrom the shadow of the Supernatural. Now the highest imagination isconcerned about the soul of things; it may or may not inspire the Fantasythat peoples with images the interlunar vague. Still, one of these lyrics,in its smaller way, affects us with a sense of uniqueness, as surely as thesublimer works of a supernatural cast,--Marlowe's \"Faustus,\" the \"Faust\" ofGoethe, \"Manfred,\" or even those ethereal masterpieces, \"The Tempest\" and\"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" More than one, while otherwise unique, hassome burden or refrain which haunts the memory,--once heard, neverforgotten, like the tone of a rarely used but distinctive organ-stop.Notable among them is B\u00fcrger's \"Lenore,\" that ghostly and resonant ballad,the lure and foil of the translators. Few will deny that Coleridge'swondrous \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" stands at their very head. \"LeJuif-Errant\" would have claims, had Beranger been a greater poet; and, butfor their remoteness from popular sympathy, \"The Lady of Shalott\" and \"TheBlessed Damozel\" might be added to the list. It was given to Edgar AllanPoe to produce two lyrics, \"The Bells\" and _The Raven_, each of which,although perhaps of less beauty than those of Tennyson and Rossetti, is aunique. \"Ulalume,\" while equally strange and imaginative, has not theuniversal quality that is a portion of our test._The Raven_ in sheer poetical constituents falls below such pieces as \"TheHaunted Palace,\" \"The City in the Sea,\" \"The Sleeper,\" and \"Israfel.\" Thewhole of it would be exchanged, I suspect, by readers of a fastidious cast,for such passages as these:    \"Around, by lifting winds forgot,    Resignedly beneath the sky    The melancholy waters lie.    No rays from the holy heaven come down    On the long night-time of that town;    But light from out the lurid sea    Streams up the turrets silently--           * * *    Up many and many a marvellous shrine    Whose wreath\u00e9d friezes intertwine    The viol, the violet, and the vine.           * * *    No swellings tell that winds may be    Upon some far-off happier sea--    No heavings hint that winds have been    On seas less hideously serene.\"It lacks the aerial melody of the poet whose heart-strings are a lute:    \"And they say (the starry choir      And the other listening things)    That Israfeli's fire    Is owing to that lyre      By which he sits and sings--    The trembling living wire      Of those unusual strings.\"But _The Raven_, like \"The Bells\" and \"Annabel Lee,\" commends itself to themany and the few. I have said elsewhere that Poe's rarer productions seemedto me \"those in which there is the appearance, at least, ofspontaneity,--in which he yields to his feelings, while dying falls andcadences most musical, most melancholy, come from him unawares.\" This isstill my belief; and yet, upon a fresh study of this poem, it impresses memore than at any time since my boyhood. Close acquaintance tells in favorof every true work of art. Induce the man, who neither knows art nor caresfor it, to examine some poem or painting, and how soon its force takes holdof him! In fact, he will overrate the relative value of the first good workby which his attention has been fairly caught. _The Raven_, also, hasconsistent qualities which even an expert must admire. In no other of itsauthor's poems is the motive more palpably defined. \"The Haunted Palace\" isjust as definite to the select reader, but Poe scarcely would have takenthat subtle allegory for bald analysis. _The Raven_ is wholly occupied withthe author's typical theme--the irretrievable loss of an idolized andbeautiful woman; but on other grounds, also, the public instinct is correctin thinking it his representative poem.A man of genius usually gains a footing with the success of some oneeffort, and this is not always his greatest. Recognition is the moreinstant for having been postponed. He does not acquire it, like a miser'sfortune, coin after coin, but \"not at all or all in all.\" And thus withother ambitions: the courtier, soldier, actor,--whatever their parts,--eachcounts his triumph from some lucky stroke. Poe's Raven, despite augury, wasfor him \"the bird that made the breeze to blow.\" The poet settled inNew-York, in the winter of 1844-'45, finding work upon Willis's paper, \"TheEvening Mirror,\" and eking out his income by contributions elsewhere. Forsix years he had been an active writer, and enjoyed a professionalreputation; was held in both respect and misdoubt, and was at no loss forhis share of the ill-paid journalism of that day. He also had done much ofhis very best work,--such tales as \"Ligeia\" and \"The Fall of the House ofUsher,\" (the latter containing that mystical counterpart, in verse, ofElihu Vedder's \"A Lost Mind,\") such analytic feats as \"The Gold Bug\" and\"The Mystery of Marie Roget.\" He had made proselytes abroad, and gained alasting hold upon the French mind. He had learned his own power andweakness, and was at his prime, and not without a certain reputation. Buthe had written nothing that was on the tongue of everybody. To rare anddelicate work some popular touch must be added to capture the generalaudience of one's own time.Through the industry of Poe's successive biographers, the hit made by _TheRaven_ has become an oft-told tale. The poet's young wife, Virginia, wasfading before his eyes, but lingered for another year within death'sshadow. The long, low chamber in the house near the Bloomingdale Road isas famous as the room where Rouget de l'Isle composed the Marseillaise.All have heard that the poem, signed \"Quarles,\" appeared in the \"AmericanReview,\" with a pseudo-editorial comment on its form; that Poe received tendollars for it; that Willis, the kindest and least envious of fashionablearbiters, reprinted it with a eulogy that instantly made it town-talk. Alldoubt of its authorship was dispelled when Poe recited it himself at aliterary gathering, and for a time he was the most marked of Americanauthors. The hit stimulated and encouraged him. Like another and proudersatirist, he too found \"something of summer\" even \"in the hum of insects.\"Sorrowfully enough, but three years elapsed,--a period of influence, pride,anguish, yet always of imaginative or critical labor,--before the finaldefeat, before the curtain dropped on a life that for him was in truth atragedy, and he yielded to \"the Conqueror Worm.\"\"The American Review: A Whig Journal\" was a creditable magazine for thetime, double-columned, printed on good paper with clear type, andillustrated by mezzotint portraits. Amid much matter below the presentstandard, it contained some that any editor would be glad to receive. Theinitial volume, for 1845, has articles by Horace Greeley, Donald Mitchell,Walter Whitman, Marsh, Tuckerman, and Whipple. Ralph Hoyt's quaint poem,\"Old,\" appeared in this volume. And here are three lyrics by Poe: \"The Cityin the Sea,\" \"The Valley of Unrest,\" and _The Raven_. Two of these werebuilt up,--such was his way,--from earlier studies, but the last-named cameout as if freshly composed, and almost as we have it now. The statementthat it was not afterward revised is erroneous. Eleven trifling changesfrom the magazine-text appear in _The Raven and Other Poems_, 1845, a bookwhich the poet shortly felt encouraged to offer the public. These aremostly changes of punctuation, or of single words, the latter kind made toheighten the effect of alliteration. In Mr. Lang's pretty edition of Poe'sverse, brought out in the \"Parchment Library,\" he has shown the instinct ofa scholar, and has done wisely, in going back to the text in the volumejust mentioned, as given in the London issue of 1846. The \"standard\"Griswold collection of the poet's works abounds with errors. These havebeen repeated by later editors, who also have made errors of their own. Butthe text of _The Raven_, owing to the requests made to the author formanuscript copies, was still farther revised by him; in fact, he printed itin Richmond, just before his death, with the poetic substitution of\"seraphim whose foot-falls\" for \"angels whose faint foot-falls,\" in thefourteenth stanza. Our present text, therefore, while substantially that of1845, is somewhat modified by the poet's later reading, and is, I think,the most correct and effective version of this single poem. The mostradical change from the earliest version appeared, however, in the volumein 1845; the eleventh stanza originally having contained these lines,faulty in rhyme and otherwise a blemish on the poem:    \"Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful Disaster    Followed fast and followed faster--so, when Hope he would adjure,    Stern Despair returned, instead of the sweet Hope he dared adjure--                                          That sad answer, 'Nevermore!'\"It would be well if other, and famous, poets could be as sure of makingtheir changes always improvements. Poe constantly rehandled his scanty showof verse, and usually bettered it. _The Raven_ was the first of the fewpoems which he nearly brought to completion before printing. It may be thatthose who care for poetry lost little by his death. Fluent in prose, henever wrote verse for the sake of making a poem. When a refrain of imagehaunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he himselfsaid, of a passion, not of a purpose. This was at intervals so rare asalmost to justify the Fairfield theory that each was the product of anervous crisis.What, then, gave the poet his clue to _The Raven_? From what mistyfoundation did it rise slowly to a music slowly breathed? As usual, morethan one thing went to the building of so notable a poem. Considering thelonger sermons often preached on brief and less suggestive texts, I hopenot to be blamed for this discussion of a single lyric,--especially onewhich an artist like Dor\u00e9 has made the subject of prodigal illustration.Until recently I had supposed that this piece, and a few which its authorcomposed after its appearance, were exceptional in not having grown fromgerms in his boyish verse. But Mr. Fearing Gill has shown me someunpublished stanzas by Poe, written in his eighteenth year, and entitled,\"The Demon of the Fire.\" The manuscript appears to be in the poet's earlyhandwriting, and its genuineness is vouched for by the family in whosepossession it has remained for half a century. Besides the plainest germsof \"The Bells\" and \"The Haunted Palace\" it contains a few lines somewhatsuggestive of the opening and close of _The Raven_. As to the rhythm of ourpoem, a comparison of dates indicates that this was influenced by therhythm of \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship.\" Poe was one of the first to honorMiss Barrett's genius; he inscribed his collected poems to her as \"thenoblest of her sex,\" and was in sympathy with her lyrical method. Thelines from her love-poem,    \"With a murmurous stir uncertain, in the air, the purple curtain    Swelleth in and swelleth out around her motionless pale brows,\"found an echo in these:    \"And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain    Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before.\"Here Poe assumed a privilege for which he roughly censured Longfellow, andwhich no one ever sought on his own premises without swift detection andchastisement. In melody and stanzaic form, we shall see that the two poemsare not unlike, but in motive they are totally distinct. The generouspoetess felt nothing but the true originality of the poet. \"This vividwriting!\" she exclaimed,--\"this power which is felt!... Our great poet, Mr.Browning, author of 'Paracelsus,' &c., is enthusiastic in his admiration ofthe rhythm.\" Mr. Ingram, after referring to \"Lady Geraldine,\" cleverlypoints out another source from which Poe may have caught an impulse. In1843, Albert Pike, the half-Greek, half-frontiersman, poet of Arkansas, hadprinted in \"The New Mirror,\" for which Poe then was writing, some versesentitled \"Isadore,\" but since revised by the author and called \"The WidowedHeart.\" I select from Mr. Pike's revision the following stanza, of whichthe main features correspond with the original version:    \"Restless I pace our lonely rooms, I play our songs no more,    The garish sun shines flauntingly upon the unswept floor;    The mocking-bird still sits and sings, O melancholy strain!    For my heart is like an autumn-cloud that overflows with rain;                            Thou art lost to me forever, Isadore!\"Here we have a prolonged measure, a similarity of refrain, and theintroduction of a bird whose song enhances sorrow. There are other trailswhich may be followed by the curious; notably, a passage which Mr. Ingramselects from Poe's final review of \"Barnaby Rudge\":     \"The raven, too, * * * might have been made, more than we now see     it, a portion of the conception of the fantastic Barnaby. * * * Its     character might have performed, in regard to that of the idiot,     much the same part as does, in music, the accompaniment in respect     to the air.\"Nevertheless, after pointing out these germs and resemblances, the value ofthis poem still is found in its originality. The progressive music, thescenic detail and contrasted light and shade,--above all, the spiritualpassion of the nocturn, make it the work of an informing genius. As for thegruesome bird, he is unlike all the other ravens of his clan, from the \"twacorbies\" and \"three ravens\" of the balladists to Barnaby's rumpled \"Grip.\"Here is no semblance of the cawing rook that haunts ancestral turrets andtreads the field of heraldry; no boding phantom of which Tickell sang that,when,            \"shrieking at her window thrice,        The raven flap'd his wing,    Too well the love-lorn maiden knew        The solemn boding sound.\"Poe's raven is a distinct conception; the incarnation of a mourner's agonyand hopelessness; a sable embodied Memory, the abiding chronicler of doom,a type of the Irreparable. Escaped across the Styx, from \"the Night'sPlutonian shore,\" he seems the imaged soul of the questioner himself,--ofhim who can not, will not, quaff the kind nepenthe, because the memory ofLenore is all that is left him, and with the surcease of his sorrow eventhat would be put aside._The Raven_ also may be taken as a representative poem of its author, forits exemplification of all his notions of what a poem should be. These arefound in his essays on \"The Poetic Principle,\" \"The Rationale of Verse,\"and \"The Philosophy of Composition.\" Poe declared that \"in Music, perhaps,the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspired by thePoetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.... Versecannot be better designated than as an inferior or less capable music\"; butagain, verse which is really the \"Poetry of Words\" is \"The RhythmicalCreation of Beauty,\"--this and nothing more. The _tone_ of the highestBeauty is one of Sadness. The most melancholy of topics is Death. This mustbe allied to Beauty. \"The death, then, of a beautiful woman is,unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world,--and equally is itbeyond doubt that the lips best suited for such a topic are those of abereaved lover.\" These last expressions are quoted from Poe's whimsicalanalysis of this very poem, but they indicate precisely the general rangeof his verse. The climax of \"The Bells\" is the muffled monotone of ghouls,who glory in weighing down the human heart. \"Lenore,\" _The Raven_, \"TheSleeper,\" \"To One in Paradise,\" and \"Ulalume\" form a tenebrosesymphony,--and \"Annabel Lee,\" written last of all, shows that one themepossessed him to the end. Again, these are all nothing if not musical, andsome are touched with that quality of the Fantastic which awakes the senseof awe, and adds a new fear to agony itself. Through all is dimly outlined,beneath a shadowy pall, the poet's ideal love,--so often half-portrayedelsewhere,--the entombed wife of Usher, the Lady Ligeia, in truth thecounterpart of his own nature. I suppose that an artist's love for one \"inthe form\" never can wholly rival his devotion to some ideal. The woman nearhim must exercise her spells, be all by turns and nothing long, charm himwith infinite variety, or be content to forego a share of his allegiance.He must be lured by the Unattainable, and this is ever just beyond him inhis passion for creative art.Poe, like Hawthorne, came in with the decline of the Romantic school, andnone delighted more than he to laugh at its calamity. Yet his heart waswith the romancers and their Oriental or Gothic effects. His invention, sorich in the prose tales, seemed to desert him when he wrote verse; and hisjudgment told him that long romantic poems depend more upon incident thaninspiration,--and that, to utter the poetry of romance, lyrics wouldsuffice. Hence his theory, clearly fitted to his own limitations, that \"a'long poem' is a flat contradiction in terms.\" The components of _TheRaven_ are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at awoman. But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. What havewe? The midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; thestudent,--a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintrynight and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vaguemistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallidbust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All thisstage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, andeven melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits,and thoroughly reflective of the poet's \"eternal passion, eternal pain.\"The rhythmical structure of _The Raven_ was sure to make an impression.Rhyme, alliteration, the burden, the stanzaic form, were devised withsingular adroitness. Doubtless the poet was struck with the aptness of MissBarrett's musical trochaics, in \"eights,\" and especially by the arrangementadopted near the close of \"Lady Geraldine\":    \"'Eyes,' he said, 'now throbbing through me! Are ye eyes that did undo me?    Shining eyes, like antique jewels set in Parian statue-stone!    Underneath that calm white forehead, are ye ever burning torrid    O'er the desolate sand-desert of my heart and life undone?'\"His artistic introduction of a third rhyme in both the second and fourthlines, and the addition of a fifth line and a final refrain, made thestanza of _The Raven_. The persistent alliteration seems to come withouteffort, and often the rhymes within lines are seductive; while the refrainor burden dominates the whole work. Here also he had profited by MissBarrett's study of ballads and romaunts in her own and other tongues. A\"refrain\" is the lure wherewith a poet or a musician holds the wanderingear,--the recurrent longing of Nature for the initial strain. I have alwaysadmired the beautiful refrains of the English songstress,--\"TheNightingales, the Nightingales,\" \"Margret, Margret,\" \"My Heart and I,\"\"Toll slowly,\" \"The River floweth on,\" \"Pan, Pan is dead,\" etc. She alsoemployed what I term the Repetend, in the use of which Poe has excelled allpoets since Coleridge thus revived it:    \"O happy living things! no tongue    Their beauty might declare:    A spring of love gushed from my heart,    And I blessed them unaware:    Sure my kind saint took pity on me,    And I blessed them unaware.\"Poe created the fifth line of his stanza for the magic of the repetend. Herelied upon it to the uttermost in a few later poems,--\"Lenore,\" \"AnnabelLee,\" \"Ulalume,\" and \"For Annie.\" It gained a wild and melancholy music, Ihave thought, from the \"sweet influences,\" of the Afric burdens andrepetends that were sung to him in childhood, attuning with their nativemelody the voice of our Southern poet.\"The Philosophy of Composition,\" his analysis of _The Raven_, is atechnical dissection of its method and structure. Neither his avowal ofcold-blooded artifice, nor his subsequent avowal to friends that anexposure of this artifice was only another of his intellectual hoaxes, needbe wholly credited. If he had designed the complete work in advance, hescarcely would have made so harsh a prelude of rattle-pan rhymes to thedelicious melody of the second stanza,--not even upon his theory of thefantastic. Of course an artist, having perfected a work, sees, like thefirst Artist, that it is good, and sees why it is good. A subsequentanalysis, coupled with a disavowal of any sacred fire, readily enough maybe made. My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of thispoem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how itmight be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter onComposition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false norwholly true. The harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancythat artificial processes can supersede imagination. The impulse of geniusis to guard the secrets of its creative hour. Glimpses obtained of thetoil, the baffled experiments, which precede a triumph, as in thesketch-work of Hawthorne recently brought to light, afford pricelessinstruction and encouragement to the sincere artist. But one whovoluntarily exposes his Muse to the gaze of all comers should recall thefate of King Candaules.The world still thinks of Poe as a \"luckless man of genius.\" I recentlyheard him mentioned as \"one whom everybody seems chartered to misrepresent,decry or slander.\" But it seems to me that his ill-luck ended with hispitiable death, and that since then his defence has been persistent, andhis fame of as steadfast growth as a suffering and gifted author could prayfor in his hopeful hour. Griswold's decrial and slander turned the currentin his favor. Critics and biographers have come forward with successiverefutations, with tributes to his character, with new editions of hisworks. His own letters and the minute incidents of his career are beforeus; the record, good and bad, is widely known. No appellor has receivedmore tender and forgiving judgement. His mishaps in life belonged to hisregion and period, perchance still more to his own infirmity of will.Doubtless his environment was not one to guard a fine-grained, ill-balancednature from perils without and within. His strongest will, to be lord ofhimself, gained for him \"that heritage of woe.\" He confessed himself thebird's unhappy master, the stricken sufferer of this poem. But his was afull share of that dramatic temper which exults in the presage of its owndoom. There is a delight in playing one's high part: we are all gladiators,crying _Ave Imperator!_ To quote Burke's matter of fact: \"In grief thepleasure is still uppermost, and the affliction we suffer has noresemblance to absolute pain, which is always odious, and which we endeavorto shake off as soon as possible.\" Poe went farther, and was an artist evenin the tragedy of his career. If, according to his own belief, sadness andthe vanishing of beauty are the highest poetic themes, and poetic feelingthe keenest earthly pleasure, then the sorrow and darkness of his brokenlife were not without their frequent compensation.In the following pages, we have a fresh example of an artist's geniuscharacterizing his interpretation of a famous poem. Gustave Dor\u00e9, the lastwork of whose pencil is before us, was not the painter, or even thedraughtsman, for realists demanding truth of tone, figure, and perfection.Such matters concerned him less than to make shape and distance, light andshade, assist his purpose,--which was to excite the soul, the imagination,of the looker on. This he did by arousing our sense of awe, throughmarvellous and often sublime conceptions of things unutterable and full ofgloom or glory. It is well said that if his works were not great paintings,as pictures they are great indeed. As a \"literary artist,\" and such he was,his force was in direct ratio with the dramatic invention of his author,with the brave audacities of the spirit that kindled his own. Hence hissuccess with Rabelais, with \"Le Juif-Errant,\" \"Les Contes Drolatiques,\" and\"Don Quixote,\" and hence, conversely, his failure to express the beauty ofTennyson's Idyls, of \"Il Paradiso,\" of the Hebrew pastorals, and othertexts requiring exaltation, or sweetness and repose. He was a born masterof the grotesque, and by a special insight could portray the spectres of ahaunted brain. We see objects as his personages saw them, and with the veryeyes of the Wandering Jew, the bewildered Don, or the goldsmith's daughterwhose fancy so magnifies the King in the shop on the Pont-au-Change. It wasin the nature of things that he should be attracted to each masterpiece ofverse or prose that I have termed unique. The lower kingdoms were calledinto his service; his rocks, trees and mountains, the sky itself, areanimate with motive and diablerie. Had he lived to illustrate Shakespeare,we should have seen a remarkable treatment of Caliban, the Witches, thestorm in \"Lear\"; but doubtless should have questioned his ideals of Imogenor Miranda. Beauty pure and simple, and the perfect excellence thereof, herarely seemed to comprehend.Yet there is beauty in his designs for the \"Ancient Mariner,\" unreal asthey are, and a consecutiveness rare in a series by Dor\u00e9. The Rime affordedhim a prolonged story, with many shiftings of the scene. In _The Raven_sound and color preserve their monotone and we have no change of place oroccasion. What is the result? Dor\u00e9 proffers a series of variations upon thetheme as he conceived it, \"the enigma of death and the hallucination of aninconsolable soul.\" In some of these drawings his faults are evident;others reveal his powerful originality, and the best qualities in which, asa draughtsman, he stood alone. Plainly there was something in commonbetween the working moods of Poe and Dor\u00e9. This would appear more clearlyhad the latter tried his hand upon the \"Tales of the Grotesque andArabesque.\" Both resorted often to the elf-land of fantasy and romance. Inmelodramatic feats they both, through their command of the supernatural,avoided the danger-line between the ideal and the absurd. Poe was the truerworshipper of the Beautiful; his love for it was a consecrating passion,and herein he parts company with his illustrator. Poet or artist, Death atlast transfigures all: within the shadow of his sable harbinger, Vedder'ssymbolic crayon aptly sets them face to face, but enfolds them with themantle of immortal wisdom and power. An American woman has wrought theimage of a star-eyed Genius with the final torch, the exquisite semblanceof one whose vision beholds, but whose lips may not utter, the mysteries ofa land beyond \"the door of a legended tomb.\"EDMUND C. STEDMAN.THE POEM.[Illustration]THE RAVEN.Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\"'T is some visiter,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--                                          Only this, and nothing more.\"Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.Eagerly I wished the morrow:--vainly I had sought to borrowFrom my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--                                          Nameless here for evermore.And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\"'T is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber doorSome late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;--                                          This it is, and nothing more.\"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door;--                                          Darkness there, and nothing more.Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"                                          Merely this and nothing more.Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before.\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--                                          'T is the wind and nothing more!\"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--                                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,--Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"                                          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                          With such name as \"Nevermore.\"But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke onlyThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"                                          Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful DisasterFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore                                          Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linkingFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                                          Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease recliningOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er                                          _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censerSwung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent theeRespite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"                                          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"                                          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil--prophet still, if bird or devil!By that Heaven that bends above, us--by that God we both adore--Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"                                          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"\"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked, upstarting--\"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"                                          Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sittingOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor                                          Shall be lifted--nevermore![Illustration]    \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,    Over many a quaint and curious

HTML version by Al Haines.*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO ***Produced by Levent Kurnaz.  HTML version by Al Haines.The Cask of AmontilladobyEdgar Allan PoeThe thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, butwhen he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who so well knowthe nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utteranceto a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a point definitelysettled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved,precluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but punish withimpunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes itsredresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to makehimself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I givenFortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, tosmile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was atthe thought of his immolation.He had a weak point--this Fortunato--although in other regards he was aman to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself on hisconnoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time andopportunity--to practise imposture upon the British and Austrian_millionaires_.  In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen,was a quack--but in the matter of old wines he was sincere.  In thisrespect I did not differ from him materially: I was skillful in theItalian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could.It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of thecarnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me withexcessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man wore motley.He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head wassurmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased to see him,that I thought I should never have done wringing his hand.I said to him--\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How remarkablywell you are looking to-day!  But I have received a pipe of what passesfor Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\"\"How?\" said he.  \"Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the middleof the carnival!\"\"I have my doubts,\" I replied; \"and I was silly enough to pay the fullAmontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not tobe found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\"\"Amontillado!\"\"I have my doubts.\"\"Amontillado!\"\"And I must satisfy them.\"\"Amontillado!\"\"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has acritical turn, it is he.  He will tell me--\"\"Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\"\"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for yourown.\"\"Come, let us go.\"\"Whither?\"\"To your vaults.\"\"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I perceiveyou have an engagement.  Luchesi--\"\"I have no engagement;--come.\"\"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold withwhich I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp.They are encrusted with nitre.\"\"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado!You have been imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguishSherry from Amontillado.\"Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm. Putting on a maskof black silk, and drawing a _roquelaire_ closely about my person, Isuffered him to hurry me to my palazzo.There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry inhonour of the time.  I had told them that I should not return until themorning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house.These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure their immediatedisappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned.I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato,bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led intothe vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting himto be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot of thedescent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of theMontresors.The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingledas he strode.\"The pipe,\" said he.\"It is farther on,\" said I; \"but observe the white web-work whichgleams from these cavern walls.\"He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs thatdistilled the rheum of intoxication.\"Nitre?\" he asked, at length.\"Nitre,\" I replied.  \"How long have you had that cough?\"\"Ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh!ugh! ugh!\"My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.\"It is nothing,\" he said, at last.\"Come,\" I said, with decision, \"we will go back; your health isprecious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, asonce I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  Wewill go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides,there is Luchesi--\"\"Enough,\" he said; \"the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me.I shall not die of a cough.\"\"True--true,\" I replied; \"and, indeed, I had no intention of alarmingyou unnecessarily--but you should use all proper caution. A draught ofthis Medoc will defend us from the damps.\"Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row ofits fellows that lay upon the mould.\"Drink,\" I said, presenting him the wine.He raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to mefamiliarly, while his bells jingled.\"I drink,\" he said, \"to the buried that repose around us.\"\"And I to your long life.\"He again took my arm, and we proceeded.\"These vaults,\" he said, \"are extensive.\"\"The Montresors,\" I replied, \"were a great and numerous family.\"\"I forget your arms.\"\"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpentrampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.\"\"And the motto?\"\"_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\"\"Good!\" he said.The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy grewwarm with the Medoc.  We had passed through walls of piled bones, withcasks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses ofcatacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made bold to seizeFortunato by an arm above the elbow.\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon thevaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickleamong the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Yourcough--\"\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught ofthe Medoc.\"I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at abreath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threwthe bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.I looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\"Not I,\" I replied.\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\"How?\"\"You are not of the masons.\"\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"\"A mason,\" I replied.\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds ofmy _roquelaire_.\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceedto the Amontillado.\"\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and againoffering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued ourroute in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of lowarches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deepcrypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather toglow than flame.At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another lessspacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to thevault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Threesides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and laypromiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of somesize.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, weperceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in widththree, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed forno especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval betweentwo of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and wasbacked by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured topry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light didnot enable us to see.\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadilyforward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant hehad reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progressarrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and Ihad fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples,distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one ofthese depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing thelinks about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secureit.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key Istepped back from the recess.\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling thenitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you toreturn.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must firstrender you all the little attentions in my power.\"\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from hisastonishment.\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of whichI have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantityof building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid ofmy trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discoveredthat the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. Theearliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depthof the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then along and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, andthe fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  Thenoise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken toit with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down uponthe bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventhtier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I againpaused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a fewfeeble rays upon the figure within.A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from thethroat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For abrief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I beganto grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instantreassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,and felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells ofhim who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volumeand in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I hadcompleted the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished aportion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stoneto be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I placedit partially in its destined position.  But now there came from out theniche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It wassucceeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing as thatof the noble Fortunato.  The voice said--\"Ha! ha! ha!--he! he! he!--a very good joke indeed--an excellent jest.We shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo--he! he!he!--over our wine--he! he! he!\"\"The Amontillado!\" I said.\"He! he! he!--he! he! he!--yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not gettinglate?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady Fortunatoand the rest?  Let us be gone.\"\"Yes,\" I said, \"let us be gone.\"\"_For the love of God, Montresor!_\"\"Yes,\" I said, \"for the love of God!\"But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew impatient.I called aloud--\"Fortunato!\"No answer.  I called again--\"Fortunato--\"No answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture andlet it fall within.  There came forth in reply only a jingling of thebells.  My heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs.I hastened to make an end of my labour.  I forced the last stone intoits position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I re-erectedthe old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no mortal hasdisturbed them.  _In pace requiescat!_End of Project Gutenberg's The Cask of Amontillado, by Edgar Allan Poe*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CASK OF AMONTILLADO ***    Updated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

DE BERANGER.During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in theautumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in theheavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through asingularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself,as the shades of the evening drew on, within view of themelancholy House of Usher.  I know not how it was--but, with thefirst glimpse of the building, a sense of insufferable gloompervaded my spirit.  I say insufferable; for the feeling wasunrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable, because poetic,sentiment, with which the mind usually receives even the sternestnatural images of the desolate or terrible.  I looked upon thescene before me--upon the mere house, and the simple landscapefeatures of the domain--upon the bleak walls--upon the vacanteye-like windows--upon a few rank sedges--and upon a few whitetrunks of decayed trees--with an utter depression of soul which Ican compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to theafter-dream of the reveller upon opium--the bitter lapse intoeveryday life--the hideous dropping off of the veil.  There wasan iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart--an unredeemeddreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination couldtorture into aught of the sublime.  What was it--I paused tothink--what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation ofthe House of Usher?  It was a mystery all insoluble; nor could Igrapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as Ipondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactoryconclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinationsof very simple natural objects which have the power of thusaffecting us, still the analysis of this power lies amongconsiderations beyond our depth.  It was possible, I reflected,that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of thescene, of the details of the picture, would be sufficient tomodify, or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowfulimpression; and, acting upon this idea, I reined my horseto the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay inunruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down--but with ashudder even more thrilling than before--upon the remodelled andinverted images of the grey sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems,and the vacant and eye-like windows.Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed tomyself a sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher,had been one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years hadelapsed since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had latelyreached me in a distant part of the country--a letter fromhim--which, in its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of noother than a personal reply.  The MS gave evidence of nervousagitation.  The writer spoke of acute bodily illness--of a mentaldisorder which oppressed him--and of an earnest desire to see me,as his best, and indeed his only personal friend, with a view ofattempting, by the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviationof his malady.  It was the manner in which all this, and muchmore, was said--it was the apparent heart that went with hisrequest--which allowed me no room for hesitation; and Iaccordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a verysingular summons.Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yetI really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been alwaysexcessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his veryancient family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiarsensibility of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages,in many works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, inrepeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well asin a passionate devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even morethan to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musicalscience.  I had learned, too, the very remarkable fact, that thestem of the Usher race, all time-honoured as it was, had putforth, at no period, any enduring branch; in other words, thatthe entire family lay in the direct line of descent, and hadalways, with very trifling and very temporary variation, so lain.It was this deficiency, I considered, while running over inthought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises withthe accredited character of the people, and while speculatingupon the possible influence which the one, in the longlapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other--it wasthis deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequentundeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony withthe name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to mergethe original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocalappellation of the \"House of Usher\"--an appellation which seemedto include, in the minds of the peasantry who used it, both thefamily and the family mansion.I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childishexperiment--that of looking down within the tarn--had been todeepen the first singular impression.  There can be no doubt thatthe consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition--forwhy should I not so term it?--served mainly to accelerate theincrease itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical lawof all sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might havebeen for this reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes tothe house itself, from its image in the pool, there grew in mymind a strange fancy--a fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I butmention it to show the vivid force of the sensations whichoppressed me.  I had so worked upon my imagination as really tobelieve that about the whole mansion and domain there hung anatmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity--anatmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven, butwhich had reeked up from the decayed trees, and the grey wall,and the silent tarn--a pestilent and mystic vapour, dull,sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.Shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream,I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Itsprincipal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.The discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungioverspread the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-workfrom the eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinarydilapidation.  No portion of the masonry had fallen; and thereappeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfectadaptation of parts, and the crumbling condition of theindividual stones.  In this there was much that reminded me ofthe specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for longyears in some neglected vault, with no disturbance from thebreath of the external air.  Beyond  this indication ofextensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token ofinstability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer mighthave discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extendingfrom the roof of the building in front, made its way down thewall in a zigzag direction, until it became lost in the sullenwaters of the tarn.Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to thehouse.  A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered theGothic archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thenceconducted me, in silence, through many dark and intricatepassages in my progress to the studio of his master.  Muchthat I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, toheighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.While the objects around me--while the carvings of the ceilings,the sombre tapestries of the walls, the ebony blackness of thefloors, and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled asI strode, were but matters to which, or to such as which, I hadbeen accustomed from my infancy--while I hesitated not toacknowledge how familiar was all this--I still wondered to findhow unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images werestirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the physician ofthe family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingledexpression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me withtrepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door andushered me into the presence of his master.The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast adistance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessiblefrom within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their waythrough the trellised panes, and served to render sufficientlydistinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, orthe recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperieshung upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse,comfortless, antique, and tattered.  Many books and musicalinstruments lay scattered about, but failed to give any vitalityto the scene.  I felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.An air of stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom hung over andpervaded all.Upon my entrance, Usher rose from a sofa on which he hadbeen lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmthwhich had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdonecordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuye man ofthe world.  A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced meof his perfect sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments,while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity,half of awe.  Surely, man had never before so terribly altered,in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher!  It was withdifficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of theman being before me with the companion of my early boyhood.  Yetthe character of his face had been at all times remarkable.  Acadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminousbeyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of asurpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model,but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; afinely-moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of awant of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like softness andtenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above theregions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance noteasily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of theprevailing character of these features, and of the expressionthey were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted towhom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the nowmiraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and evenawed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow allunheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated ratherthan fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connectits Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with anincoherence--an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arisefrom a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome anhabitual trepidancy--an excessive nervous agitation.  Forsomething of this nature I had indeed been prepared, no less byhis letter, than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits, andby conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformationand temperament.  His action was alternately vivacious andsullen.  His voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision(when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance) tothat species of energetic concision--that abrupt, weighty,unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation--that leaden,self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which maybe observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater ofopium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of hisearnest desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me toafford him.  He entered, at some length, into what he conceivedto be the nature of his malady.  It was, he said, aconstitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despairedto find a remedy--a mere nervous affection, he immediately added,which would undoubtedly soon pass off.  It displayed itself in ahost of unnatural sensations.  Some of these, as he detailedthem, interested and bewildered me; although, perhaps, the terms,and the general manner of the narration had their weight.  Hesuffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses; the mostinsipid food was alone endurable; he could wear only garments ofcertain texture; the odours of all flowers were oppressive; hiseyes were tortured by even a faint light; and there were butpeculiar sounds, and these from stringed instruments, which didnot inspire him with horror.To an anomalous species of terror I found him a boundenslave.  \"I shall perish,\" said he, \"I must perish in thisdeplorable folly.  Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I belost.  I dread the events of the future, not in themselves, butin their results.  I shudder at the thought of any, even the mosttrivial, incident, which may operate upon this intolerableagitation of soul.  I have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger,except in its absolute effect--in terror.  In this unnerved--inthis pitiable condition--I feel that the period will sooner orlater arrive when I must abandon life and reason together, insome struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.\"I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken andequivocal hints, another singular feature of his mentalcondition.  He was enchained by certain superstitious impressionsin regard to the dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for manyyears, he had never ventured forth--in regard to an influencewhose supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy hereto be re-stated--an influence which some peculiarities in themere form and substance of his family mansion, had, bydint of long sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit--aneffect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets, andof the dim tarn into which they all looked down, had, at length,brought about upon the morale of his existence.He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much ofthe peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to amore natural and far more palpable origin--to the severe andlong-continued illness--indeed to the evidently approachingdissolution--of a tenderly beloved sister--his sole companion forlong years--his last and only relative on earth.  \"Her decease,\"he said, with a bitterness which I can never forget, \"would leavehim (him the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient raceof the Ushers.\"  While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so wasshe called) passed slowly through a remote portion of theapartment, and, without having noticed my presence, disappeared.I regarded her with an utter astonishment not unmingled withdread--and yet I found it impossible to account for suchfeelings.  A sensation of stupor oppressed me, as my eyesfollowed her retreating steps.  When a door, at length, closedupon her, my glance sought instinctively and eagerly thecountenance of the brother--but he had buried his face in hishands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinarywanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through whichtrickled many passionate tears.The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skillof her physicians.  A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away ofthe person, and frequent although transient affections of apartially cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.Hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of hermalady, and had not betaken herself finally to bed; but, on theclosing in of the evening of my arrival at the house, shesuccumbed (as her brother told me at night with inexpressibleagitation) to the prostrating power of the destroyer; and Ilearned that the glimpse I had obtained of her person would thusprobably be the last I should obtain--that the lady, at leastwhile living, would be seen by me no more.For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by eitherUsher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnestendeavours to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  Wepainted and read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, tothe wild improvisations of his speaking guitar.  And thus, as acloser and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedlyinto the recesses of his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceivethe futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from whichdarkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth uponall objects of the moral and physical universe, in one unceasingradiation of gloom.I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hoursI thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.  Yet Ishould fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exactcharacter of the studies, or of the occupations, in which heinvolved me, or led me the way.  An excited and highlydistempered ideality threw a sulphureous lustre over all.  Hislong improvised dirges will ring for ever in my ears.  Amongother things, I hold painfully in mind a certain singularperversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz ofVon Weber.  From the paintings over which his elaborate fancybrooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into vagueness at whichI shuddered the more thrillingly, because I shuddered knowing notwhy;--from these paintings (vivid as their images now are beforeme) I would in vain endeavour to educe more than a small portionwhich should lie within the compass of merely written words.  Bythe utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, hearrested and overawed attention.  If ever mortal painted an idea,that mortal was Roderick Usher.  For me at least--in thecircumstances then surrounding me--there arose out of the pureabstractions which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon hiscanvas, an intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which feltI ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet tooconcrete reveries of Fuseli.One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend,partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may beshadowed forth, although feebly, in words.  A small picturepresented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vaultor tunnel, with low walls, smooth, white, and withoutinterruption or device.  Certain accessory points of the designserved well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at anexceeding depth below the surface of the earth.  No outlet wasobserved in any portion of its vast extent, and no torch,or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a floodof intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in aghastly and inappropriate splendour.I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditorynerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, withthe exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.  Itwas, perhaps, the narrow limits to which he thus confined himselfupon the guitar, which gave birth, in great measure, to thefantastic character of the performances.  But the fervidfacility of his impromptus could not be so accounted for.They must have been, and were, in the notes, as well as in thewords of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently accompaniedhimself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of thatintense mental collectedness and concentration to which I havepreviously alluded as observable only in particular moments ofthe highest artificial excitement.  The words of one of theserhapsodies I have easily remembered.  I was, perhaps, the moreforcibly impressed with it, as he gave it, because, in the underor mystic current of its meaning, I fancied that I perceived, andfor the first time, a full consciousness on the part of Usher, ofthe tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.  The verses,which were entitled \"The Haunted Palace,\" ran very nearly, if notaccurately, thus:                            I.               In the greenest of our valleys,                 By good angels tenanted,               Once a fair and stately palace--                 Radiant palace--reared its head.               In the monarch Thought's dominion--                 It stood there!               Never seraph spread a pinion                 Over fabric half so fair.                           II.               Banners yellow, glorious, golden,                 On its roof did float and flow;               (This--all this--was in the olden                 Time long ago)               And every gentle air that dallied,                 In that sweet day,               Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,                 A winged odour went away.                           III.               Wanderers in that happy valley                 Through two luminous windows saw               Spirits moving musically                 To a lute's well tuned law,               Round about a throne, where sitting                 (Porphyrogene!)               In state his glory well befitting,                 The ruler of the realm was seen.                           IV.               And all with pearl and ruby glowing                 Was the fair palace door,               Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing                 And sparkling evermore,               A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty                 Was but to sing,               In voices of surpassing beauty,                 The wit and wisdom of their king.                            V.               But evil things, in robes of sorrow,                 Assailed the monarch's high estate;               (Ah, let us mourn, for never morrow                 Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)               And, round about his home, the glory                 That blushed and bloomed               Is but a dim-remembered story,                 Of the old time entombed.                           VI.               And travellers now within that valley,                 Through the red-litten windows, see               Vast forms that move fantastically                 To a discordant melody;               While, like a rapid ghastly river,                 Through the pale door,               A hideous throng rush out forever,                 And laugh--but smile no more.I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad,led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest anopinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of itsnovelty (for other men* have thought thus,) as on account of thepertinacity with which he maintained it.  This opinion, in itsgeneral form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daringcharacter, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon thekingdom of inorganization.  I lack words to express the fullextent, or the earnest abandon of his persuasion.  Thebelief, however, was connected (as I have previously hinted) withthe gray stones of the home of his forefathers.  The conditionsof the sentience had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in themethod of collocation of these stones--in the order of theirarrangement, as well as in that of the many fungi whichoverspread them, and of the decayed trees which stood around--aboveall, in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement,and in its reduplication in the still waters of the tarn.  Itsevidence--the evidence of the sentience--was to be seen, he said,(and I here started as he spoke,) in the gradual yet certaincondensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters andthe walls.  The result was discoverable, he added, in thatsilent, yet importunate and terrible influence which forcenturies had moulded the destinies of his family, and which madehim what I now saw him--what he was.  Such opinions need nocomment, and I will make none.Our books--the books which, for years, had formed no smallportion of the mental existence of the invalid--were, as might besupposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.  Wepored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuseof Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven andHell of Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm byHolberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indagine,and of De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance ofTieck; and the City of the Sun by Campanella.  One favouritevolume was a small octavo edition of the DirectoriumInquisitorum, by the Dominican Eymeric de Gironne; and therewere passages in Pomponius Mela, about the old African Satyrsand OEgipans, over which Usher would sit dreaming for hours.  Hischief delight, however, was found in the perusal of anexceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic--the manual ofa forgotten church--the Vigiliae Mortuorum Secundum Chorum EcclesiaeMaguntinae.I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work,and of its probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, oneevening, having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline wasno more, he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for afortnight, (previously to its final interment), in one of thenumerous vaults within the main walls of the building.  Theworldly reason, however, assigned for this singular proceeding,was one which I did not feel at liberty to dispute.  The brotherhad been led to his resolution (so he told me) by considerationof the unusual character of the malady of the deceased, ofcertain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of her medicalmen, and of the remote and exposed situation of the burial-groundof the family.  I will not deny that when I called to mind thesinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the staircase,on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to opposewhat I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means anunnatural, precaution.At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in thearrangements for the temporary entombment.  The body having beenencoffined, we two alone bore it to its rest.  The vault in whichwe placed it (and which had been so long unopened that ourtorches, half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave uslittle opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, andentirely without means of admission for light; lying, at greatdepth, immediately beneath that portion of the building in whichwas my own sleeping apartment.  It had been used, apparently, inremote feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and,in later days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some otherhighly combustible substance, as a portion of its floor,and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reachedit, were carefully sheathed with copper.  The door, of massiveiron, had been, also, similarly protected.  Its immense weightcaused an unusually sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels withinthis region of horror, we partially turned aside the yetunscrewed lid of the coffin, and looked upon the face of thetenant.  A striking similitude between the brother and sister nowfirst arrested my attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, mythoughts, murmured out some few words from which I learned thatthe deceased and himself had been twins, and that sympathies of ascarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them.Our glances, however, rested not long upon the dead--for we couldnot regard her unawed.  The disease which had thus entombed thelady in the maturity of youth, had left, as usual in all maladiesof a strictly cataleptical character, the mockery of a faintblush upon the bosom and the face, and that suspiciouslylingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death.  Wereplaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the doorof iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomyapartments of the upper portion of the house.And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, anobservable change came over the features of the mental disorderof my friend.  His ordinary manner had vanished.  His ordinaryoccupations were neglected or forgotten.  He roamed from chamberto chamber with hurried, unequal, and objectless step.  Thepallor of his countenance had assumed, if possible, a moreghastly hue--but the luminousness of his eye had utterly goneout.  The once occasional huskiness of his tone was heard nomore; and a tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habituallycharacterized his utterance.  There were times, indeed, when Ithought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with someoppressive secret, to divulge which he struggled for thenecessary courage.  At times, again, I was obliged to resolve allinto the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness, for I beheld himgazing upon vacancy for long hours, in an attitude of theprofoundest attention, as if listening to some imaginarysound.  It was no wonder that his condition terrified--that itinfected me.  I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certaindegrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressivesuperstitions.It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the nightof the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the ladyMadeline within the donjon, that I experienced the full power ofsuch feelings.  Sleep came not near my couch--while the hourswaned and waned away.  I struggled to reason off the nervousnesswhich had dominion over me.  I endeavoured to believe that much,if not all of what I felt, was due to the bewildering influenceof the gloomy furniture of the room--of the dark and tattereddraperies, which, tortured into motion by the breath of a risingtempest, swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls, and rustleduneasily about the decorations of the bed.  But my efforts werefruitless.  An irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame;and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an incubus ofutterly causeless alarm.  Shaking this off with a gasp and astruggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peeringearnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber, hearkened--Iknow not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me--tocertain low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pausesof the storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.  Overpoweredby an intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable,I threw on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleepno more during the night,) and endeavoured to arouse myself fromthe pitiable condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidlyto and fro through the apartment.I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light stepon an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.  I presentlyrecognized it as that of Usher.  In an instant afterwards herapped, with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing alamp.  His countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan--but,moreover, there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes--anevidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour.  Hisair appalled me--but anything was preferable to the solitudewhich I had so long endured, and I even welcomed his presence asa relief.\"And you have not seen it?\" he said abruptly, after havingstared about him for some moments in silence--\"you havenot then seen it?--but, stay! you shall.\"  Thus speaking, andhaving carefully shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of thecasements, and threw it freely open to the storm.The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted usfrom our feet.  It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternlybeautiful night, and one wildly singular in its terror and itsbeauty.  A whirlwind had apparently collected its force in ourvicinity; for there were frequent and violent alterations in thedirection of the wind; and the exceeding density of the clouds(which hung so low as to press upon the turrets of the house) didnot prevent our perceiving the lifelike velocity with which theyflew careering from all points against each other, withoutpassing away into the distance.  I say that even their exceedingdensity did not prevent our perceiving this--yet we had noglimpse of the moon or stars--nor was there any flashing forth ofthe lightning.  But the under surfaces of the huge masses ofagitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediatelyaround us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintlyluminous and distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hungabout and enshrouded the mansion.\"You must not--you shall not behold this!\" said I,shudderingly, to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence,from the window to a seat.  \"These appearances, which bewilderyou, are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon--or it may bethat they have their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of thetarn.  Let us close this casement;--the air is chilling anddangerous to your frame.  Here is one of your favourite romances.I will read, and you shall listen;--and so we will pass away thisterrible night together.\"The antique volume which I had taken up was the \"MadTrist\" of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favouriteof Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, thereis little in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which couldhave had interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of myfriend.  It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; andI indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitatedthe hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mentaldisorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness ofthe folly which I should read.  Could I have judged, indeed, bythe wild overstrained air of vivacity with which hehearkened, or apparently hearkened, to the words of the tale, Imight well have congratulated myself upon the success of mydesign.I had arrived at that well-known portion of the story whereEthelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain forpeaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds tomake good an entrance by force.  Here, it will be remembered, thewords of the narrative run thus:\"And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and whowas now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the winewhich he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with thehermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn,but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the risingof the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, madequickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntletedhand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, andripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry andhollow-sounding wood alarmed and reverberated throughout theforest.\"At the termination of this sentence I started, and for amoment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at onceconcluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)--it appeared tome that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, therecame, indistinctly, to my ears, what might have been, in itsexact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dullone certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which SirLauncelot had so particularly described.  It was, beyond doubt,the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention; for, amidthe rattling of the sashes of the casements, and the ordinarycommingled noises of the still increasing storm, the sound, initself, had nothing, surely, which should have interested ordisturbed me.  I continued the story:\"But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within thedoor, was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of themaliceful hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scalyand prodigious demeanour, and of a fiery tongue, which sat inguard before a palace of gold, with a floor of silver; and uponthe wall there hung a shield of shining brass with this legendenwritten--     Who entereth herein, a conquerer hath bin;     Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;and Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of thedragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, witha shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, thatEthelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against thedreadful noise of it, the like whereof was never before heard.\"Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wildamazement--for there could be no doubt whatever that, in thisinstance, I did actually hear (although from what direction itproceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparentlydistant, but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming orgrating sound--the exact counterpart of what my fancy had alreadyconjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by theromancer.Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of thesecond and most extraordinary coincidence, by a thousandconflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror werepredominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind toavoid exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness ofmy companion.  I was by no means certain that he had noticed thesounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alterationhad, during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanour.From a position fronting my own, he had gradually brought roundhis chair, so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber;and thus I could but partially perceive his features, although Isaw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.His head had dropped upon his breast--yet I knew that he was notasleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught aglance of it in profile.  The motion of his body, too, was atvariance with this idea--for he rocked from side to side with agentle yet constant and uniform sway.  Having rapidly takennotice of all this, I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot,which thus proceeded:\"And now, the champion, having escaped from the terriblefury of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, andof the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removedthe carcass from out of the way before him, and approachedvalorously over the silver pavement of the castle to wherethe shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for hisfull coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor,with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound.\"No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than--as if ashield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon afloor of silver--I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic,and clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completelyunnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movementof Usher was undisturbed.  I rushed to the chair in which he sat.His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his wholecountenance there reigned a stony rigidity.  But, as I placed myhand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over hiswhole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I sawthat he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as ifunconscious of my presence.  Bending closely over him, I atlength drank in the hideous import of his words.\"Not hear it?--yes, I hear it, and have heard it.Long--long--long--many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heardit--yet I dared not--oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!--Idared not--I dared not speak!  We have put her living inthe tomb!  Said I not that my senses were acute?  I now tellyou that I heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.I heard them--many, many days ago--yet I dared not--I darednot speak!  And now--to-night--Ethelred--ha! ha!--the breakingof the hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and theclangour of the shield!--say, rather, the rending of her coffin,and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and herstruggles within the coppered archway of the vault!  Oh whithershall I fly?  Will she not be here anon?  Is she not hurrying toupbraid me for my haste?  Have I not heard her footsteps on thestair?  Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating ofher heart?  Madman!\" here he sprang furiously to his feet, andshrieked out his syllables, as if in the effort he were giving uphis soul--\"Madman!  I tell you that she now stands without thedoor!\"As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there hadbeen found the potency of a spell--the huge antique panels towhich the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant,their ponderous and ebony jaws.  It was the work of therushing gust--but then without those doors there DID stand thelofty and enshrouded figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.  Therewas blood upon her white robes, and the evidence of some bitterstruggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame.  For a momentshe remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold,--then,with a low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the personof her brother, and in her violent and now final death-agonies,bore him to the floor a corpse, and a victim to the terrors hehad anticipated.From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.The storm was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myselfcrossing the old causeway.  Suddenly there shot along the path awild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual couldhave issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behindme.  The radiance was that of the full, setting, and blood-redmoon which now shone vividly through that once barely-discerniblefissure of which I have before spoken as extending from the roofof the building, in a zigzag direction, to the base.  While Igazed, this fissure rapidly widened--there came a fierce breathof the whirlwind--the entire orb of the satellite burst at onceupon my sight--my brain reeled as I saw the mighty walls rushingasunder--there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like thevoice of a thousand waters--and the deep and dank tarn at my feetclosed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the \"House ofUsher\".* Watson, Dr Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of Landaff.End of Project Gutenberg's The Fall of the House of Usher, by Edgar Allan Poe*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER ***    Updated editions will replace the previous one\u2014the old editions willbe renamed.Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.

IngramPREFACE.In placing before the public this collection of Edgar Poe's poeticalworks, it is requisite to point out in what respects it differs from,and is superior to, the numerous collections which have preceded it.Until recently, all editions, whether American or English, of Poe'spoems have been 'verbatim' reprints of the first posthumous collection,published at New York in 1850.In 1874 I began drawing attention to the fact that unknown andunreprinted poetry by Edgar Poe was in existence. Most, if not all, ofthe specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted bydifferent editors and publishers, but the present is the first occasionon which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf.Besides the poems thus alluded to, this volume will be found to containmany additional pieces and extra stanzas, nowhere else published orincluded in Poe's works. Such verses have been gathered from printed ormanuscript sources during a research extending over many years.In addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume,attention should, also, be solicited on behalf of the notes, which willbe found to contain much matter, interesting both from biographical andbibliographical points of view.JOHN H.

The result has not beenaltogether satisfactory. On the one hand, envy and prejudice havemagnified every blemish of his character into crime, whilst on theother, blind admiration would depict him as far \"too good for humannature's daily food.\" Let us endeavor to judge him impartially, grantingthat he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality,but that he was tempted sorely, treated badly, and suffered deeply.The poet's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explainingsome of the complexities of his character. His father, David Poe, was ofAnglo-Irish extraction. Educated for the Bar, he elected to abandon itfor the stage. In one of his tours through the chief towns of the UnitedStates he met and married a young actress, Elizabeth Arnold, member ofan English family distinguished for its musical talents. As an actress,Elizabeth Poe acquired some reputation, but became even better known forher domestic virtues. In those days the United States afforded littlescope for dramatic energy, so it is not surprising to find that when herhusband died, after a few years of married life, the young widow had avain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones, William Henry,Edgar, and Rosalie. Before her premature death, in December, 1811, thepoet's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on thecharity of her neighbors.Edgar, the second child of David and Elizabeth Poe, was born at Boston,in the United States, on the 19th of January, 1809. Upon his mother'sdeath at Richmond, Virginia, Edgar was adopted by a wealthy Scotchmerchant, John Allan. Mr. Allan, who had married an American lady andsettled in Virginia, was childless. He therefore took naturally to thebrilliant and beautiful little boy, treated him as his son, and made himtake his own surname. Edgar Allan, as he was now styled, after someelementary tuition in Richmond, was taken to England by his adoptedparents, and, in 1816, placed at the Manor House School,Stoke-Newington.Under the Rev. Dr. Bransby, the future poet spent a lustrum of his lifeneither unprofitably nor, apparently, ungenially. Dr. Bransby, who ishimself so quaintly portrayed in Poe's tale of 'William Wilson',described \"Edgar Allan,\" by which name only he knew the lad, as \"a quickand clever boy,\" who \"would have been a very good boy had he not beenspoilt by his parents,\" meaning, of course, the Allans. They \"allowedhim an extravagant amount of pocket-money, which enabled him to get intoall manner of mischief. Still I liked the boy,\" added the tutor, \"but,poor fellow, his parents spoiled him.\"Poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited storyof 'William Wilson'. Probably there is the usual amount of poeticexaggeration in these reminiscences, but they are almost the only recordwe have of that portion of his career and, therefore, apart from theirliterary merits, are on that account deeply interesting. The descriptionof the sleepy old London suburb, as it was in those days, is remarkablyaccurate, but the revisions which the story of 'William Wilson' wentthrough before it reached its present perfect state caused many of theauthor's details to deviate widely from their original correctness. Hisschoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an \"old,irregular, and cottage-built\" dwelling, and so it remained until itsdestruction a few years ago.The 'soi-disant' William Wilson, referring to those bygone happy daysspent in the English academy, says,  \"The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident  to occupy or amuse it. The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to  bed; the connings, the recitations, the periodical half-holidays and  perambulations, the playground, with its broils, its pastimes, its  intrigues--these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to  involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, a  universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and  spirit-stirring, _'Oh, le bon temps, que ce si\u00e8cle de fer!'\"_From this world of boyish imagination Poe was called to his adoptedparents' home in the United States. He returned to America in 1821, andwas speedily placed in an academy in Richmond, Virginia, in which citythe Allans continued to reside. Already well grounded in the elementaryprocesses of education, not without reputation on account of hisEuropean residence, handsome, proud, and regarded as the heir of awealthy man, Poe must have been looked up to with no little respect byhis fellow pupils. He speedily made himself a prominent position in theschool, not only by his classical attainments, but by his athleticfeats--accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads.  \"In the simple school athletics of those days, when a gymnasium had  not been heard of, he was 'facile princeps',\"is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil, Colonel T. L. Preston. Poe heremembers as  \"a swift runner, a wonderful leaper, and, what was more rare, a boxer,  with some slight training.... He would allow the strongest boy in the  school to strike him with full force in the chest. He taught me the  secret, and I imitated him, after my measure. It was to inflate the  lungs to the uttermost, and at the moment of receiving the blow to  exhale the air. It looked surprising, and was, indeed, a little rough;  but with a good breast-bone, and some resolution, it was not difficult  to stand it. For swimming he was noted, being in many of his athletic  proclivities surprisingly like Byron in his youth.\"In one of his feats Poe only came off second best.  \"A challenge to a foot race,\" says Colonel Preston, \"had been passed  between the two classical schools of the city; we selected Poe as our  champion. The race came off one bright May morning at sunrise, in the  Capitol Square. Historical truth compels me to add that on this  occasion our school was beaten, and we had to pay up our small bets.  Poe ran well, but his competitor was a long-legged, Indian-looking  fellow, who would have outstripped Atalanta without the help of the  golden apples.\"  \"In our Latin exercises in school,\" continues the colonel, \"Poe was  among the first--not first without dispute. We had competitors who  fairly disputed the palm, especially one, Nat Howard, afterwards known  as one of the ripest scholars in Virginia, and distinguished also as a  profound lawyer. If Howard was less brilliant than Poe, he was far  more studious; for even then the germs of waywardness were developing  in the nascent poet, and even then no inconsiderable portion of his  time was given to versifying. But if I put Howard as a Latinist on a  level with Poe, I do him full justice.\"  \"Poe,\" says the colonel, \"was very fond of the Odes of Horace, and  repeated them so often in my hearing that I learned by sound the words  of many before I understood their meaning. In the lilting rhythm of  the Sapphics and Iambics, his ear, as yet untutored in more  complicated harmonies, took special delight. Two odes, in particular,  have been humming in my ear all my life since, set to the tune of his  recitation:    _'Jam satis terris nivis atque dirce    Grandinis misit Pater, et rubente,'_  And    _'Non ebur neque aureum    Mea renidet in dono lacu ar,_' etc.  \"I remember that Poe was also a very fine French scholar. Yet, with  all his superiorities, he was not the master spirit nor even the  favorite of the school. I assign, from my recollection, this place to  Howard. Poe, as I recall my impressions now, was self-willed,  capricious, inclined to be imperious, and, though of generous  impulses, not steadily kind, nor even amiable; and so what he would  exact was refused to him. I add another thing which had its influence,  I am sure. At the time of which I speak, Richmond was one of the most  aristocratic cities on this side of the Atlantic.... A school is, of  its nature, democratic; but still boys will unconsciously bear about  the odor of their fathers' notions, good or bad. Of Edgar Poe,\" who  had then resumed his parental cognomen, \"it was known that his parents  had been players, and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is  bestowed upon an adopted son. All this had the effect of making the  boys decline his leadership; and, on looking back on it since, I fancy  it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had.\"This last paragraph of Colonel Preston's recollections cast a suggestivelight upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad's early life andtended to blight his prospective hopes. Although mixing with members ofthe best families of the province, and naturally endowed with hereditaryand native pride,--fostered by the indulgence of wealth and theconsciousness of intellectual superiority,--Edgar Poe was made to feelthat his parentage was obscure, and that he himself was dependent uponthe charity and caprice of an alien by blood. For many lads these thingswould have had but little meaning, but to one of Poe's proud temperamentit must have been a source of constant torment, and all allusions to itgall and wormwood. And Mr. Allan was not the man to wean Poe from suchfestering fancies: as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talentedboy, and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase, but at othertimes he treated him with contumely, and made him feel the bitterness ofhis position.Still Poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at thatVirginian academy, and several still living have favored us withreminiscences of him. His feats in swimming to which Colonel Preston hasalluded, are quite a feature of his youthful career. Colonel Mayorecords one daring performance in natation which is thoroughlycharacteristic of the lad. One day in mid-winter, when standing on thebanks of the James River, Poe dared his comrade into jumping in, inorder to swim to a certain point with him. After floundering about inthe nearly frozen stream for some time, they reached the piles uponwhich Mayo's Bridge was then supported, and there attempted to rest andtry to gain the shore by climbing up the log abutment to the bridge.Upon reaching the bridge, however, they were dismayed to find that itsplank flooring overlapped the abutment by several feet, and that it wasimpossible to ascend it. Nothing remained for them but to let go theirslippery hold and swim back to the shore. Poe reached the bank in anexhausted and benumbed condition, whilst Mayo was rescued by a boat justas he was succumbing. On getting ashore Poe was seized with a violentattack of vomiting, and both lads were ill for several weeks.Alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own, the poetremarked, \"Any 'swimmer in the falls' in my days would have swum theHellespont, and thought nothing of the matter. I swam from Ludlam'sWharf to Warwick (six miles), in a hot June sun, against one of thestrongest tides ever known in the river. It would have been a featcomparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water. I would notthink much,\" Poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him,\"of attempting to swim the British Channel from Dover to Calais.\"Colonel Mayo, who had tried to accompany him in this performance, had tostop on the way, and says that Poe, when he reached the goal, emergedfrom the water with neck, face, and back blistered. The facts of thisfeat, which was undertaken for a wager, having been questioned, Poe,ever intolerant of contradiction, obtained and published the affidavitsof several gentlemen who had witnessed it. They also certified that Poedid not seem at all fatigued, and that he walked back to Richmondimmediately after the performance.The poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have beenslight in figure and person, but to have been well made, active, sinewy,and graceful. Despite the fact that he was thus noted among hisschoolfellows and indulged at home, he does not appear to have been insympathy with his surroundings. Already dowered with the \"hate of hate,the scorn of scorn,\" he appears to have made foes both among those whoenvied him and those whom, in the pride of intellectuality, he treatedwith pugnacious contempt. Beneath the haughty exterior, however, was awarm and passionate heart, which only needed circumstance to call forthan almost fanatical intensity of affection. A well-authenticatedinstance of this is thus related by Mrs. Whitman:  \"While at the academy in Richmond, he one day accompanied a schoolmate  to his home, where he saw, for the first time, Mrs. Helen Stannard,  the mother of his young friend. This lady, on entering the room, took  his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome, which  so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him  of the power of speech, and for a time almost of consciousness itself.  He returned home in a dream, with but one thought, one hope in life --to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the  desolate world so beautiful to him, and filled his lonely heart with  the oppression of a new joy. This lady afterwards became the confidant  of all his boyish sorrows, and hers was the one redeeming influence  that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and  passionate youth.\"When Edgar was unhappy at home, which, says his aunt, Mrs. Clemm, \"wasvery often the case, he went to Mrs. Stannard for sympathy, forconsolation, and for advice.\" Unfortunately, the sad fortune which sofrequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship. The lady wasoverwhelmed by a terrible calamity, and at the period when her guidingvoice was most requisite, she fell a prey to mental alienation. Shedied, and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery, but her poor boyishadmirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken inher vaulted home, so he would leave the house at night and visit hertomb. When the nights were drear, \"when the autumnal rains fell, and thewinds wailed mournfully over the graves, he lingered longest, and cameaway most regretfully.\"The memory of this lady, of this \"one idolatrous and purely ideal love\"of his boyhood, was cherished to the last. The name of Helen frequentlyrecurs in his youthful verses, \"The P\u00e6an,\" now first included in hispoetical works, refers to her; and to her he inscribed the classic andexquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning \"Helen, thy beauty is to me.\"Another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that hewas already a poet. Among his schoolfellows he appears to have acquiredsome little reputation as a writer of satirical verses; but of hispoetry, of that which, as he declared, had been with him \"not a purpose,but a passion,\" he probably preserved the secret, especially as we knowthat at his adoptive home poesy was a forbidden thing. As early as 1821he appears to have essayed various pieces, and some of these wereultimately included in his first volume. With Poe poetry was a personalmatter--a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heartfound an outlet. With feelings such as were his, it came to pass, as amatter of course, that the youthful poet fell in love. His first affairof the heart is, doubtless, reminiscently portrayed in what he says ofhis boyish ideal, Byron. This passion, he remarks, \"if passion it canproperly be called, was of the most thoroughly romantic, shadowy, andimaginative character. It was born of the hour, and of the youthfulnecessity to love. It had no peculiar regard to the person, or to thecharacter, or to the reciprocating affection... Any maiden, notimmediately and positively repulsive,\" he deems would have suited theoccasion of frequent and unrestricted intercourse with such animaginative and poetic youth. \"The result,\" he deems, \"was not merelynatural, or merely probable; it was as inevitable as destiny itself.\"Between the lines may be read the history of his own love. \"The Egeriaof _his_ dreams--the Venus Aphrodite that sprang in full and supernalloveliness from the bright foam upon the storm-tormented ocean of _his_thoughts,\" was a little girl, Elmira Royster, who lived with her fatherin a house opposite to the Allans in Richmond. The young people metagain and again, and the lady, who has only recently passed away,recalled Edgar as \"a beautiful boy,\" passionately fond of music,enthusiastic and impulsive, but with prejudices already stronglydeveloped. A certain amount of love-making took place between the youngpeople, and Poe, with his usual passionate energy, ere he left home forthe University had persuaded his fair inamorata to engage herself tohim. Poe left home for the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, inthe beginning of 1825. lie wrote frequently to Miss Royster, but herfather did not approve of the affair, and, so the story runs,intercepted the correspondence, until it ceased. At seventeen, Elmirabecame the bride of a Mr. Shelton, and it was not until some timeafterwards that Poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals hadfailed to elicit any response from the object of his youthful affection.Poe's short university career was in many respects a repetition of hiscourse at the Richmond Academy. He became noted at Charlottesville bothfor his athletic feats and his scholastic successes. He entered as astudent on February 1,1826, and remained till the close of the secondsession in December of that year.  \"He entered the schools of ancient and modern languages, attending the  lectures on Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, and Italian. I was a member  of the last three classes,\" says Mr. William Wertenbaker, the recently  deceased librarian, \"and can testify that he was tolerably regular in  his attendance, and a successful student, having obtained distinction  at the final examination in Latin and French, and this was at that  time the highest honor a student could obtain. The present regulations  in regard to degrees had not then been adopted. Under existing  regulations, he would have graduated in the two languages above-named,  and have been entitled to diplomas.\"These statements of Poe's classmate are confirmed by Dr. Harrison,chairman of the Faculty, who remarks that the poet was a great favoritewith his fellow-students, and was noted for the remarkable rapidity withwhich he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy, histranslations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy.Several of Poe's classmates at Charlottesville have testified to his\"noble qualities\" and other good endowments, but they remember that his\"disposition was rather retiring, and that he had few intimateassociates.\" Mr. Thomas Boiling, one of his fellow-students who hasfavored us with reminiscences of him, says:  \"I was 'acquainted', with him, but that is about all. My impression  was, and is, that no one could say that he 'knew' him. He wore a  melancholy face always, and even his smile--for I do not ever remember  to have seen him laugh--seemed to be forced. When he engaged  sometimes with others in athletic exercises, in which, so far as high  or long jumping, I believe he excelled all the rest, Poe, with the  same ever sad face, appeared to participate in what was amusement to  the others more as a task than sport.\"Poe had no little talent for drawing, and Mr. John Willis states thatthe walls of his college rooms were covered with his crayon sketches,whilst Mr. Boiling mentions, in connection with the poet's artisticfacility, some interesting incidents. The two young men had purchasedcopies of a handsomely-illustrated edition of Byron's poems, and uponvisiting Poe a few days after this purchase, Mr. Bolling found himengaged in copying one of the engravings with crayon upon his dormitoryceiling. He continued to amuse himself in this way from time to timeuntil he had filled all the space in his room with life-size figureswhich, it is remembered by those who saw them, were highly ornamentaland well executed.As Mr. Bolling talked with his associate, Poe would continue to scribbleaway with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestinglyremonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied that he hadbeen all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment,assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he wastrying 'to divide his mind,' to carry on a conversation and writesensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.Mr. Wertenbaker, in his interesting reminiscences of the poet, says:  \"As librarian I had frequent official intercourse with Poe, but it was  at or near the close of the session before I met him in the social  circle. After spending an evening together at a private house he  invited me, on our return, into his room. It was a cold night in  December, and his fire having gone pretty nearly out, by the aid of  some tallow candles, and the fragments of a small table which he broke  up for the purpose, he soon rekindled it, and by its comfortable blaze  I spent a very pleasant hour with him. On this occasion he spoke with  regret of the large amount of money he had wasted, and of the debts he  had contracted during the session. If my memory be not at fault, he  estimated his indebtedness at $2,000 and, though they were gaming  debts, he was earnest and emphatic in the declaration that he was  bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity.\"This appears to have been Poe's last night at the university. He left itnever to return, yet, short as was his sojourn there, he left behind himsuch honorable memories that his 'alma mater' is now only too proud toenrol his name among her most respected sons. Poe's adopted father,however, did not regard his 'prot\u00e9g\u00e9's' collegiate career with equalpleasure: whatever view he may have entertained of the lad's scholasticsuccesses, he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which,like too many of his classmates, he had incurred. A violent altercationtook place between Mr. Allan and the youth, and Poe hastily quitted theshelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone.Taking with him such poems as he had ready, Poe made his way to Boston,and there looked up some of his mother's old theatrical friends. Whetherhe thought of adopting the stage as a profession, or whether he thoughtof getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of hisown upon the stage,--that dream of all young authors,--is now unknown.He appears to have wandered about for some time, and by some means orthe other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed \"forprivate circulation only.\" This was towards the end of 1827, when he wasnearing nineteen. Doubtless Poe expected to dispose of his volume bysubscription among his friends, but copies did not go off, andultimately the book was suppressed, and the remainder of the edition,for \"reasons of a private nature,\" destroyed.What happened to the young poet, and how he contrived to exist for thenext year or so, is a mystery still unsolved. It has always beenbelieved that he found his way to Europe and met with some curiousadventures there, and Poe himself certainly alleged that such was thecase. Numbers of mythical stories have been invented to account for thischasm in the poet's life, and most of them self-evidently fabulous. In arecent biography of Poe an attempt had been made to prove that heenlisted in the army under an assumed name, and served for abouteighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner,receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of Mr. Allan. Thisaccount is plausible, but will need further explanation of its manydiscrepancies of dates, and verification of the different documentscited in proof of it, before the public can receive it as fact. So manyfables have been published about Poe, and even many fictitious documentsquoted, that it behoves the unprejudiced to be wary in accepting any newstatements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated.On the 28th February, 1829, Mrs. Allan died, and with her death thefinal thread that had bound Poe to her husband was broken. The adoptedson arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence hadgiven the Allan residence its only claim upon the poet's heart. A kindof truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased lady, but, forthe future, Poe found that home was home no longer.Again the young man turned to poetry, not only as a solace but as ameans of earning a livelihood. Again he printed a little volume ofpoems, which included his longest piece, \"Al Aaraaf,\" and several othersnow deemed classic. The book was a great advance upon his previouscollection, but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personalprofit for its author.Feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that hesaw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for alivelihood, Poe expressed a wish to enter the army. After no littledifficulty a cadetship was obtained for him at the West Point MilitaryAcademy, a military school in many respects equal to the best in Europefor the education of officers for the army. At the time Poe entered theAcademy it possessed anything but an attractive character, thediscipline having been of the most severe character, and theaccommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads.The poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with hisusual enthusiasm, and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of theplace with unusual steadiness. He entered the institution on the 1stJuly, 1830, and by the following March had been expelled for determineddisobedience. Whatever view may be taken of Poe's conduct upon thisoccasion, it must be seen that the expulsion from West Point was of hisown seeking. Highly-colored pictures have been drawn of his eccentricbehavior at the Academy, but the fact remains that he wilfully, or atany rate purposely, flung away his cadetship. It is surmised withplausibility that the second marriage of Mr. Allan, and his expressedintention of withdrawing his help and of not endowing or bequeathingthis adopted son any of his property, was the mainspring of Poe'saction. Believing it impossible to continue without aid in a professionso expensive as was a military life, he determined to relinquish it andreturn to his long cherished attempt to become an author.Expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter, anddiscarded by his former protector, the unfortunate and penniless youngman yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters bymeans of a volume of poetry. If it be true, as alleged, that several ofhis brother cadets aided his efforts by subscribing for his little work,there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latestventure. Whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid, it is certainthat in a short time after leaving the Military Academy Poe was reducedto sad straits. He disappeared for nearly two years from public notice,and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorilyexplained. In 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner ofa hundred-dollar award offered by a newspaper for the best story.The prize was unanimously adjudged to Poe by the adjudicators, and Mr.Kennedy, an author of some little repute, having become interested bythe young man's evident genius, generously assisted him towardsobtaining a livelihood by literary labor. Through his new friend'sintroduction to the proprietor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', amoribund magazine published at irregular intervals, Poe became first apaid contributor, and eventually the editor of the publication, whichultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitableperiodicals of the day. This success was entirely due to the brilliancyand power of Poe's own contributions to the magazine.In March, 1834, Mr. Allan died, and if our poet had maintained any hopesof further assistance from him, all doubt was settled by the will, bywhich the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife andher three sons. Poe was not named.On the 6th May, 1836, Poe, who now had nothing but his pen to trust to,married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, a child of only fourteen, and withher mother as housekeeper, started a home of his own. In the meantimehis various writings in the 'Messenger' began to attract attention andto extend his reputation into literary circles, but beyond his editorialsalary of about $520 brought him no pecuniary reward.In January, 1837, for reasons never thoroughly explained, Poe severedhis connection with the 'Messenger', and moved with all his householdgoods from Richmond to New York. Southern friends state that Poe wasdesirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer, orof being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own laborsprocured. In New York his earnings seem to have been small andirregular, his most important work having been a republication from the'Messenger' in book form of his Defoe-like romance entitled 'ArthurGordon Pym'. The truthful air of \"The Narrative,\" as well as its othermerits, excited public curiosity both in England and America; but Poe'sremuneration does not appear to have been proportionate to its success,nor did he receive anything from the numerous European editions the workrapidly passed through.In 1838 Poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his New Yorkhome and remove with his wife and aunt (her mother) to Philadelphia. TheQuaker city was at that time quite a hotbed for magazine projects, andamong the many new periodicals Poe was enabled to earn some kind of aliving. To Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for 1837 he had contributed afew articles, but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up theeditorship. Poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own, and itwas probably with a view to such an eventuality that one of hisconditions for accepting the editorship of the 'Gentleman's Magazine'was that his name should appear upon the title-page.Poe worked hard at the 'Gentleman's' for some time, contributing to itscolumns much of his best work; ultimately, however, he came tologgerheads with its proprietor, Burton, who disposed of the magazine toa Mr. Graham, a rival publisher. At this period Poe collected into twovolumes, and got them published as 'Tales of the Grotesque andArabesques', twenty-five of his stories, but he never received anyremuneration, save a few copies of the volumes, for the work. For sometime the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own, butall his efforts failed owing to his want of capital.The purchaser of Burton's magazine, having amalgamated it with another,issued the two under the title of 'Graham's Magazine'. Poe became acontributor to the new venture, and in November of the year 1840consented to assume the post of editor.Under Poe's management, assisted by the liberality of Mr. Graham,'Graham's Magazine' became a grand success. To its pages Poe contributedsome of his finest and most popular tales, and attracted to thepublication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors. Thepublic was not slow in showing its appreciation of 'pabulum' put beforeit, and, so its directors averred, in less than two years thecirculation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies.A great deal of this success was due to Poe's weird and wonderfulstories; still more, perhaps, to his trenchant critiques and hisstartling theories anent cryptology. As regards the tales now issued in'Graham's', attention may especially be drawn to the world-famed\"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" the first of a series--'\"une esp\u00e8ce detrilogie,\"' as Baudelaire styles them--illustrative of an analytic phaseof Poe's peculiar mind. This 'trilogie' of tales, of which the later twowere \"The Purloined Letter\" and \"The Mystery of Marie Roget,\" wasavowedly written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddlesof life by identifying another person's mind by our own. By trying tofollow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing,Poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive,as it were, at that person's conclusions, indeed, penetrate theinnermost arcanum of his brain and read his most secret thoughts. Whilstthe public was still pondering over the startling proposition, andenjoying perusal of its apparent proofs, Poe still further increased hispopularity and drew attention to his works by putting forward theattractive but less dangerous theorem that \"human ingenuity could notconstruct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve.\"This cryptographic assertion was made in connection with what the publicdeemed a challenge, and Poe was inundated with ciphers more or lessabstruse, demanding solution. In the correspondence which ensued in'Graham's Magazine' and other publications, Poe was universallyacknowledged to have proved his case, so far as his own personal abilityto unriddle such mysteries was concerned. Although he had never offeredto undertake such a task, he triumphantly solved every cryptogram sentto him, with one exception, and that exception he proved conclusivelywas only an imposture, for which no solution was possible.The outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was thefascinating story of \"The Gold Bug,\" a story in which the discovery ofhidden treasure is brought about by the unriddling of an intricatecipher.The year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of Poe's checkered career. Onevery side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light, chiefeditor of a powerful magazine, admired, feared, and envied, with areputation already spreading rapidly in Europe as well as in his nativecontinent, the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness.But dark cankers were gnawing his heart. His pecuniary position wasstill embarrassing. His writings, which were the result of slow andcareful labor, were poorly paid, and his remuneration as joint editor of'Graham's' was small. He was not permitted to have undivided control,and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had renderedworld-famous, whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes,and caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted--to thatdrink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life.Edgar Poe's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was madetowards the end of his career. Its truth has never been disproved, andin its most important points it has been thoroughly substantiated. To acorrespondent he writes in January 1848:  \"You say, 'Can you _hint_ to me what was \"that terrible evil\" which  caused the \"irregularities\" so profoundly lamented?' Yes, I can do more  than hint. This _evil_ was the greatest which can befall a man. Six  years ago, a wife whom I loved as no man ever loved before, ruptured a  blood-vessel in singing. Her life was despaired of. I took leave of  her forever, and underwent all the agonies of her death. She recovered  partially, and I again hoped. At the end of a year, the vessel broke  again. I went through precisely the same scene.... Then again--again--  and even once again at varying intervals. Each time I felt all the  agonies of her death--and at each accession of the disorder I loved  her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity.  But I am constitutionally sensitive--nervous in a very unusual degree.  I became insane, with long intervals of horrible sanity. During these  fits of absolute unconsciousness, I drank--God only knows how often or  how much. As a matter of course, my enemies referred the insanity to  the drink rather than the drink to the insanity. I had, indeed, nearly  abandoned all hope of a permanent cure, when I found one in the  _death_ of my wife. This I can and do endure as becomes a man. It was  the horrible never-ending oscillation between hope and despair which I  could _not_ longer have endured, without total loss of reason.\"The poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home,superintended by his ever-faithful guardian, his wife's mother--his ownaunt, Mrs. Clemm, the lady whom he so gratefully addressed in afteryears in the well-known sonnet, as \"more than mother unto me.\" But achange came o'er the spirit of his dream! His severance from 'Graham's',owing to we know not what causes, took place, and his fragile schemes ofhappiness faded as fast as the sunset. His means melted away, and hebecame unfitted by mental trouble and ill-health to earn more. Theterrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones werereduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from Mr. A. B.Harris's reminiscences.Referring to the poet's residence in Spring Gardens, Philadelphia, thiswriter says:  \"It was during their stay there that Mrs. Poe, while singing one  evening, ruptured a blood-vessel, and after that she suffered a  hundred deaths. She could not bear the slightest exposure, and needed  the utmost care; and all those conveniences as to apartment and  surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were  almost matters of life and death to her. And yet the room where she  lay for weeks, hardly able to breathe, except as she was fanned, was a  little narrow place, with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that  her head almost touched it. But no one dared to speak, Mr. Poe was so  sensitive and irritable; 'quick as steel and flint,' said one who knew  him in those days. And he would not allow a word about the danger of  her dying: the mention of it drove him wild.\"Is it to be wondered at, should it not indeed be forgiven him, if,impelled by the anxieties and privations at home, the unfortunate poet,driven to the brink of madness, plunged still deeper into the Slough ofDespond? Unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his belovedwife, the distracted man  \"would steal out of the house at night, and go off and wander about  the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which  way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety  at home as long as she could, and then start off in search of him.\"During his calmer moments Poe exerted all his efforts to proceed withhis literary labors. He continued to contribute to 'Graham's Magazine,'the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of hislife, and also to some other leading publications of Philadelphia andNew York. A suggestion having been made to him by N. P. Willis, of thelatter city, he determined to once more wander back to it, as he foundit impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was.Accordingly, about the middle of 1845, Poe removed to New York, andshortly afterwards was engaged by Willis and his partner Morris assub-editor on the 'Evening Mirror'. He was, says Willis,  \"employed by us for several months as critic and subeditor.... He  resided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,  but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the  evening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his  genius, and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary  irregularity, we were led by common report to expect a very capricious  attention to his duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and  difficulty. Time went on, however, and he was invariably punctual and  industrious. With his pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a  reminder of what genius was in him, it was impossible, of course, not  to treat him always with deferential courtsey.... With a prospect of  taking the lead in another periodical, he at last voluntarily gave up  his employment with us.\"A few weeks before Poe relinquished his laborious and ill-paid work onthe 'Evening Mirror', his marvellous poem of \"The Raven\" was published.The effect was magical. Never before, nor, indeed, ever since, has asingle short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm. It didmore to render its author famous than all his other writings puttogether. It made him the literary lion of the season; called intoexistence innumerable parodies; was translated into various languages,and, indeed, created quite a literature of its own. Poe was naturallydelighted with the success his poem had attained, and from time to timeread it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions.Nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of art only, and wrotehis essay entitled the \"Philosophy of Composition,\" to prove that it wasmerely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain setrules.Although our poet's reputation was now well established, he found itstill a difficult matter to live by his pen. Even when in good health,he wrote slowly and with fastidious care, and when his work was done hadgreat difficulty in getting publishers to accept it. Since his death ithas been proved that many months often elapsed before he could geteither his most admired poems or tales published.Poe left the 'Evening Mirror' in order to take part in the 'BroadwayJournal', wherein he re-issued from time to time nearly the whole of hisprose and poetry. Ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical,but, having no funds to carry it on, after a few months of heartbreakinglabor he had to relinquish it. Exhausted in body and mind, theunfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to aquaint little cottage at Fordham, outside New York. Here after a timethe unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need, not evenhaving wherewith to purchase the necessities of life. At this diremoment, some friendly hand, much to the indignation and dismay of Poehimself, made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family.The appeal had the desired effect. Old friends and new came to therescue, and, thanks to them, and especially to Mrs. Shew, the \"MarieLouise\" of Poe's later poems, his wife's dying moments were soothed, andthe poet's own immediate wants provided for. In January, 1846, VirginiaPoe died; and for some time after her death the poet remained in anapathetic stupor, and, indeed, it may be truly said that never again didhis mental faculties appear to regain their former power.For another year or so Poe lived quietly at Fordham, guarded by thewatchful care of Mrs. Clemm,--writing little, but thinking out hisphilosophical prose poem of \"Eureka,\" which he deemed the crowning workof his life. His life was as abstemious and regular as his means weresmall. Gradually, however, as intercourse with fellow literatire-aroused his dormant energies, he began to meditate a fresh start inthe world. His old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting amagazine of his own, for the enunciation of his own views on literature,now absorbed all his thoughts. In order to get the necessary funds forestablishing his publication on a solid footing, he determined to give aseries of lectures in various parts of the States.His re-entry into public life only involved him in a series ofmisfortunes. At one time he was engaged to be married to Mrs. Whitman, awidow lady of considerable intellectual and literary attainments; but,after several incidents of a highly romantic character, the match wasbroken off. In 1849 Poe revisited the South, and, amid the scenes andfriends of his early life, passed some not altogether unpleasing time.At Richmond, Virginia, he again met his first love, Elmira, now awealthy widow, and, after a short renewed acquaintance, was once moreengaged to marry her. But misfortune continued to dog his steps.A publishing affair recalled him to New York. He left Richmond by boatfor Baltimore, at which city he arrived on the 3d October, and handedhis trunk to a porter to carry to the train for Philadelphia. What nowhappened has never been clearly explained. Previous to starting on hisjourney, Poe had complained of indisposition,--of chilliness and ofexhaustion,--and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance ofthese symptoms had tempted him to drink, or to resort to some of thosenarcotics he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life.Whatever the cause of his delay, the consequences were fatal. Whilst ina state of temporary mania or insensibility, he fell into the hands of aband of ruffians, who were scouring the streets in search of accomplicesor victims. What followed is given on undoubted authority.His captors carried the unfortunate poet into an electioneering den,where they drugged him with whisky. It was election day for a member ofCongress, and Poe with other victims, was dragged from polling stationto station, and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand. Incredibleas it may appear, the superintending officials of those days registeredthe proffered vote, quite regardless of the condition of the personpersonifying a voter. The election over, the dying poet was left in thestreets to perish, but, being found ere life was extinct, he was carriedto the Washington University Hospital, where he expired on the 7th ofOctober, 1849, in the forty-first year of his age.Edgar Poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather, GeneralPoe, in the presence of a few friends and relatives. On the 17thNovember, 1875, his remains were removed from their first resting-placeand, in the presence of a large number of people, were placed under amarble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers. His wife'sbody has recently been placed by his side.The story of that \"fitful fever\" which constituted the life of Edgar Poeleaves upon the reader's mind the conviction that he was, indeed, trulytypified by that:  \"Unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden  bore--  Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore  Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"JOHN H.

E.A.P.       *       *       *       *       *THE RAVEN.  Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,  Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore--  While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,  As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.  \"'Tis some visitor,\" I muttered, \"tapping at my chamber door--          Only this and nothing more.\"  Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,  And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.  Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow  From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore--  For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore--          Nameless here for evermore.  And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain  Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;  So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating  \"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--  Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--      This it is and nothing more.\"  Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  \"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;  But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,  And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,  That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--        Darkness there and nothing more.  Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,    fearing,  Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;  But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"        Merely this and nothing more.  Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,  Soon I heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.  \"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;  Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--  Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--      'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"  Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;  Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;  But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--  Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,  \"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no    craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,        With such name as \"Nevermore.\"  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only  That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.  Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--  Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--  On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\"        Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"  Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,  \"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,  Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster  Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--  Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore      Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"  But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and    door;  Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking  Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--  What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore      Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"  This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing  To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;  This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining  On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,  But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,        _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!  Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer  Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.  \"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath    sent thee  Respite--respite aad nepenth\u00e9 from thy memories of Lenore!  Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenth\u00e9, and forget this lost Lenore!\"        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--  Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,  Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--  On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore--  Is there--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!\"      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Prophet!\" said I, \"thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!  By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--  Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"        Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  \"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\" I shrieked,    upstarting--  \"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!  Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!  Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,  And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor      Shall be lifted--nevermore!Published, 1845.       *       *       *       *       *THE BELLS,I.  Hear the sledges with the bells--  Silver bells!  What a world of merriment their melody foretells!  How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,  In their icy air of night!  While the stars, that oversprinkle  All the heavens, seem to twinkle  With a crystalline delight;  Keeping time, time, time,  In a sort of Runic rhyme,  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells  From the bells, bells, bells, bells,  Bells, bells, bells--  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.II.  Hear the mellow wedding bells,  Golden bells!  What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!  Through the balmy air of night  How they ring out their delight!  From the molten golden-notes,  And all in tune,  What a liquid ditty floats  To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats  On the moon!  Oh, from out the sounding cells,  What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!  How it swells!  How it dwells  On the future! how it tells  Of the rapture that impels  To the swinging and the ringing  Of the bells, bells, bells,  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,  Bells, bells, bells--  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!III.  Hear the loud alarum bells--  Brazen bells!  What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!  In the startled ear of night  How they scream out their affright!  Too much horrified to speak,  They can only shriek, shriek,  Out of tune,  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire  Leaping higher, higher, higher,  With a desperate desire,  And a resolute endeavor  Now--now to sit or never,  By the side of the pale-faced moon.  Oh, the bells, bells, bells!  What a tale their terror tells  Of Despair!  How they clang, and clash, and roar!  What a horror they outpour  On the bosom of the palpitating air!  Yet the ear it fully knows,  By the twanging,  And the clanging,  How the danger ebbs and flows;  Yet the ear distinctly tells,  In the jangling,  And the wrangling,  How the danger sinks and swells,  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells--  Of the bells--  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,  Bells, bells, bells--  In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!IV.  Hear the tolling of the bells--  Iron bells!  What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!  In the silence of the night,  How we shiver with affright  At the melancholy menace of their tone!  For every sound that floats  From the rust within their throats     Is a groan.  And the people--ah, the people--  They that dwell up in the steeple.      All alone,  And who tolling, tolling, tolling,    In that muffled monotone,  Feel a glory in so rolling    On the human heart a stone--  They are neither man nor woman--  They are neither brute nor human--      They are Ghouls:  And their king it is who tolls;  And he rolls, rolls, rolls,           Rolls  A p\u00e6an from the bells!  And his merry bosom swells  With the p\u00e6an of the bells!  And he dances, and he yells;  Keeping time, time, time,  In a sort of Runic rhyme,  To the p\u00e6an of the bells--      Of the bells:  Keeping time, time, time,  In a sort of Runic rhyme,    To the throbbing of the bells--  Of the bells, bells, bells--    To the sobbing of the bells;  Keeping time, time, time,    As he knells, knells, knells,  In a happy Runic rhyme,  To the rolling of the bells--  Of the bells, bells, bells--  To the tolling of the bells,  Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,    Bells, bells, bells--  To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.1849.       *       *       *       *       *ULALUME.  The skies they were ashen and sober;    The leaves they were crisped and sere--    The leaves they were withering and sere;  It was night in the lonesome October    Of my most immemorial year;  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,    In the misty mid region of Weir--  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,    In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.  Here once, through an alley Titanic.    Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--    Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.  These were days when my heart was volcanic    As the scoriac rivers that roll--    As the lavas that restlessly roll  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek    In the ultimate climes of the pole--  That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek    In the realms of the boreal pole.  Our talk had been serious and sober,    But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--    Our memories were treacherous and sere--  For we knew not the month was October,  And we marked not the night of the year--    (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)  We noted not the dim lake of Auber--    (Though once we had journeyed down here)--  Remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,    Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.  And now as the night was senescent    And star-dials pointed to morn--    As the sun-dials hinted of morn--  At the end of our path a liquescent    And nebulous lustre was born,  Out of which a miraculous crescent    Arose with a duplicate horn--  Astarte's bediamonded crescent    Distinct with its duplicate horn.  And I said--\"She is warmer than Dian:    She rolls through an ether of sighs--    She revels in a region of sighs:  She has seen that the tears are not dry on    These cheeks, where the worm never dies,  And has come past the stars of the Lion    To point us the path to the skies--    To the Lethean peace of the skies--  Come up, in despite of the Lion,    To shine on us with her bright eyes--  Come up through the lair of the Lion,    With love in her luminous eyes.\"  But Psyche, uplifting her finger,    Said--\"Sadly this star I mistrust--    Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--  Oh, hasten!--oh, let us not linger!    Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.\"  In terror she spoke, letting sink her    Wings till they trailed in the dust--  In agony sobbed, letting sink her    Plumes till they trailed in the dust--    Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.  I replied--\"This is nothing but dreaming:    Let us on by this tremulous light!    Let us bathe in this crystalline light!  Its Sibyllic splendor is beaming    With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--    See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!  Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,    And be sure it will lead us aright--  We safely may trust to a gleaming    That cannot but guide us aright,    Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"  Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,    And tempted her out of her gloom--    And conquered her scruples and gloom;  And we passed to the end of a vista,    But were stopped by the door of a tomb--    By the door of a legended tomb;  And I said--\"What is written, sweet sister,    On the door of this legended tomb?\"    She replied--\"Ulalume--Ulalume--    'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!\"  Then my heart it grew ashen and sober    As the leaves that were crisped and sere--    As the leaves that were withering and sere;  And I cried--\"It was surely October    On _this_ very night of last year    That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--    That I brought a dread burden down here!    On this night of all nights in the year,    Ah, what demon has tempted me here?  Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--    This misty mid region of Weir--  Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber,--    This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\"1847.       *       *       *       *       *TO HELEN.  I saw thee once--once only--years ago:  I must not say _how_ many--but _not_ many.  It was a July midnight; and from out  A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,  Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,  There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,  With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,  Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand  Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,  Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe--  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses  That gave out, in return for the love-light,  Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death--  Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses  That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted  By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.  Clad all in white, upon a violet bank  I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon  Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,  And on thine own, upturn'd--alas, in sorrow!  Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight--  Was it not Fate (whose name is also Sorrow),  That bade me pause before that garden-gate,  To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?  No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,  Save only thee and me--(O Heaven!--O God!  How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)--  Save only thee and me. I paused--I looked--  And in an instant all things disappeared.  (Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)  The pearly lustre of the moon went out:  The mossy banks and the meandering paths,  The happy flowers and the repining trees,  Were seen no more: the very roses' odors  Died in the arms of the adoring airs.  All--all expired save thee--save less than thou:  Save only the divine light in thine eyes--  Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.  I saw but them--they were the world to me.  I saw but them--saw only them for hours--  Saw only them until the moon went down.  What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten  Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!  How dark a woe! yet how sublime a hope!  How silently serene a sea of pride!  How daring an ambition! yet how deep--  How fathomless a capacity for love!  But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,  Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;  And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees  Didst glide away. _Only thine eyes remained._  They _would not_ go--they never yet have gone.  Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,  _They_ have not left me (as my hopes have) since.  They follow me--they lead me through the years.  They are my ministers--yet I their slave.  Their office is to illumine and enkindle--  My duty, _to be saved_ by their bright light,  And purified in their electric fire,  And sanctified in their elysian fire.  They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),  And are far up in Heaven--the stars I kneel to  In the sad, silent watches of my night;  While even in the meridian glare of day  I see them still--two sweetly scintillant  Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!1846.       *       *       *       *       *ANNABEL LEE.  It was many and many a year ago,    In a kingdom by the sea,  That a maiden there lived whom you may know    By the name of ANNABEL LEE;  And this maiden she lived with no other thought    Than to love and be loved by me.  _I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea:  But we loved with a love that was more than love--    I and my ANNABEL LEE;  With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven    Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,    In this kingdom by the sea,  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling    My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;  So that her highborn kinsmen came    And bore her away from me,  To shut her up in a sepulchre    In this kingdom by the sea.  The angels, not half so happy in heaven,    Went envying her and me--  Yes!--that was the reason (as all men know,    In this kingdom by the sea)  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,    Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love    Of those who were older than we--    Of many far wiser than we--  And neither the angels in heaven above,    Nor the demons down under the sea,  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.  For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;  And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes    Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side  Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,    In her sepulchre there by the sea--    In her tomb by the side of the sea.       *       *       *       *       *A VALENTINE.  For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,    Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,  Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies    Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.  Search narrowly the lines!--they hold a treasure    Divine--a talisman--an amulet  That must be worn _at heart_. Search well the measure--    The words--the syllables! Do not forget  The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!    And yet there is in this no Gordian knot  Which one might not undo without a sabre,    If one could merely comprehend the plot.  Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering    Eyes scintillating soul, there lie _perdus_  Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing    Of poets by poets--as the name is a poet's, too.  Its letters, although naturally lying    Like the knight Pinto--Mendez Ferdinando--  Still form a synonym for Truth--Cease trying!    You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you _can_ do.1846.[To discover the names in this and the following poem, read the firstletter of the first line in connection with the second letter of thesecond line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth, of thefourth and so on, to the end.]       *       *       *       *       *AN ENIGMA.  \"Seldom we find,\" says Solomon Don Dunce,      \"Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.    Through all the flimsy things we see at once      As easily as through a Naples bonnet--      Trash of all trash!--how _can_ a lady don it?    Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff--    Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff      Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.\"    And, veritably, Sol is right enough.    The general tuckermanities are arrant    Bubbles--ephemeral and _so_ transparent--      But _this is_, now--you may depend upon it--    Stable, opaque, immortal--all by dint    Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.[See note after previous poem.]1847.       *       *       *       *       *TO MY MOTHER.  Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,    The angels, whispering to one another,  Can find, among their burning terms of love,    None so devotional as that of \"Mother,\"  Therefore by that dear name I long have called you--    You who are more than mother unto me,  And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you,    In setting my Virginia's spirit free.  My mother--my own mother, who died early,    Was but the mother of myself; but you  Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,    And thus are dearer than the mother I knew  By that infinity with which my wife    Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.1849.[The above was addressed to the poet's mother-in-law, Mrs. Clemm.--Ed.]       *       *       *       *       *FOR ANNIE.  Thank Heaven! the crisis--    The danger is past,  And the lingering illness    Is over at last--  And the fever called \"Living\"    Is conquered at last.  Sadly, I know,    I am shorn of my strength,  And no muscle I move    As I lie at full length--  But no matter!--I feel    I am better at length.  And I rest so composedly,    Now in my bed,  That any beholder    Might fancy me dead--  Might start at beholding me    Thinking me dead.  The moaning and groaning,    The sighing and sobbing,  Are quieted now,    With that horrible throbbing  At heart:--ah, that horrible,    Horrible throbbing!  The sickness--the nausea--    The pitiless pain--  Have ceased, with the fever    That maddened my brain--  With the fever called \"Living\"    That burned in my brain.  And oh! of all tortures    _That_ torture the worst  Has abated--the terrible    Torture of thirst,  For the naphthaline river    Of Passion accurst:--  I have drank of a water    That quenches all thirst:--  Of a water that flows,    With a lullaby sound,  From a spring but a very few    Feet under ground--  From a cavern not very far    Down under ground.  And ah! let it never    Be foolishly said  That my room it is gloomy    And narrow my bed--  For man never slept    In a different bed;  And, to _sleep_, you must slumber    In just such a bed.  My tantalized spirit    Here blandly reposes,  Forgetting, or never    Regretting its roses--  Its old agitations    Of myrtles and roses:  For now, while so quietly    Lying, it fancies  A holier odor    About it, of pansies--  A rosemary odor,    Commingled with pansies--  With rue and the beautiful    Puritan pansies.  And so it lies happily,    Bathing in many  A dream of the truth    And the beauty of Annie--  Drowned in a bath    Of the tresses of Annie.  She tenderly kissed me,    She fondly caressed,  And then I fell gently    To sleep on her breast--  Deeply to sleep    From the heaven of her breast.  When the light was extinguished,    She covered me warm,  And she prayed to the angels    To keep me from harm--  To the queen of the angels    To shield me from harm.  And I lie so composedly,    Now in my bed  (Knowing her love)    That you fancy me dead--  And I rest so contentedly,    Now in my bed,  (With her love at my breast)    That you fancy me dead--  That you shudder to look at me.    Thinking me dead.  But my heart it is brighter    Than all of the many  Stars in the sky,    For it sparkles with Annie--  It glows with the light    Of the love of my Annie--  With the thought of the light    Of the eyes of my Annie.1849.       *       *       *       *       *TO F--  Beloved! amid the earnest woes    That crowd around my earthly path--  (Drear path, alas! where grows  Not even one lonely rose)--    My soul at least a solace hath  In dreams of thee, and therein knows  An Eden of bland repose.  And thus thy memory is to me    Like some enchanted far-off isle  In some tumultuous sea--  Some ocean throbbing far and free    With storm--but where meanwhile  Serenest skies continually    Just o'er that one bright inland smile.1845.       *       *       *       *       *TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD.  Thou wouldst be loved?--then let thy heart    From its present pathway part not;  Being everything which now thou art,    Be nothing which thou art not.  So with the world thy gentle ways,    Thy grace, thy more than beauty,  Shall be an endless theme of praise.    And love a simple duty.1845.       *       *       *       *       *ELDORADO.    Gaily bedight,    A gallant knight,  In sunshine and in shadow,    Had journeyed long,    Singing a song,  In search of Eldorado.    But he grew old--    This knight so bold--  And o'er his heart a shadow    Fell as he found    No spot of ground  That looked like Eldorado.  And, as his strength    Failed him at length,  He met a pilgrim shadow--    \"Shadow,\" said he,    \"Where can it be--  This land of Eldorado?\"    \"Over the Mountains    Of the Moon,  Down the Valley of the Shadow,    Ride, boldly ride,\"    The shade replied,  \"If you seek for Eldorado!\"1849.       *       *       *       *       *EULALIE.               I dwelt alone               In a world of moan,           And my soul was a stagnant tide,  Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride--  Till the yellow-haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride.               Ah, less--less bright               The stars of the night           Than the eyes of the radiant girl!               And never a flake               That the vapor can make           With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,  Can vie with the modest Eulalie's most unregarded curl--  Can compare with the bright-eyed Eulalie's most humble and careless    curl.               Now Doubt--now Pain               Come never again,           For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,               And all day long               Shines, bright and strong,           Astart\u00e9 within the sky,  While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye--  While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye.1845.       *       *       *       *       *A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM.  Take this kiss upon the brow!  And, in parting from you now,  Thus much let me avow--  You are not wrong, who deem  That my days have been a dream:  Yet if hope has flown away  In a night, or in a day,  In a vision or in none,  Is it therefore the less _gone_?  _All_ that we see or seem  Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar  Of a surf-tormented shore,  And I hold within my hand  Grains of the golden sand--  How few! yet how they creep  Through my fingers to the deep  While I weep--while I weep!  O God! can I not grasp  Them with a tighter clasp?  O God! can I not save  _One_ from the pitiless wave?  Is _all_ that we see or seem  But a dream within a dream?1849.       *       *       *       *       *TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW).  Of all who hail thy presence as the morning--  Of all to whom thine absence is the night--  The blotting utterly from out high heaven  The sacred sun--of all who, weeping, bless thee  Hourly for hope--for life--ah, above all,  For the resurrection of deep buried faith  In truth, in virtue, in humanity--  Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed  Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen  At thy soft-murmured words, \"Let there be light!\"  At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled  In thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes--  Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude  Nearest resembles worship,--oh, remember  The truest, the most fervently devoted,  And think that these weak lines are written by him--  By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think  His spirit is communing with an angel's.1847.       *       *       *       *       *TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW).  Not long ago, the writer of these lines,  In the mad pride of intellectuality,  Maintained \"the power of words\"--denied that ever  A thought arose within the human brain  Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:  And now, as if in mockery of that boast,  Two words--two foreign soft dissyllables--  Italian tones, made only to be murmured  By angels dreaming in the moonlit \"dew  That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,\"--  Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,  Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,  Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions  Than even the seraph harper, Israfel,  (Who has \"the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,\")  Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.  The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.  With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,  I cannot write--I cannot speak or think--  Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,  This standing motionless upon the golden  Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,  Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,  And thrilling as I see, upon the right,  Upon the left, and all the way along,  Amid empurpled vapors, far away  To where the prospect terminates--_thee only_!       *       *       *       *       *THE CITY IN THE SEA.  Lo! Death has reared himself a throne  In a strange city lying alone  Far down within the dim West,  Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best  Have gone to their eternal rest.  There shrines and palaces and towers  (Time-eaten towers and tremble not!)  Resemble nothing that is ours.  Around, by lifting winds forgot,  Resignedly beneath the sky  The melancholy waters lie.  No rays from the holy Heaven come down  On the long night-time of that town;  But light from out the lurid sea  Streams up the turrets silently--  Gleams up the pinnacles far and free--  Up domes--up spires--up kingly halls--  Up fanes--up Babylon-like walls--  Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers  Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers--  Up many and many a marvellous shrine  Whose wreathed friezes intertwine  The viol, the violet, and the vine.  Resignedly beneath the sky  The melancholy waters lie.  So blend the turrets and shadows there  That all seem pendulous in air,  While from a proud tower in the town  Death looks gigantically down.  There open fanes and gaping graves  Yawn level with the luminous waves;  But not the riches there that lie  In each idol's diamond eye--  Not the gaily-jewelled dead  Tempt the waters from their bed;  For no ripples curl, alas!  Along that wilderness of glass--  No swellings tell that winds may be  Upon some far-off happier sea--  No heavings hint that winds have been  On seas less hideously serene.  But lo, a stir is in the air!  The wave--there is a movement there!  As if the towers had thrust aside,  In slightly sinking, the dull tide--  As if their tops had feebly given  A void within the filmy Heaven.  The waves have now a redder glow--  The hours are breathing faint and low--  And when, amid no earthly moans,  Down, down that town shall settle hence,  Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,  Shall do it reverence.1835?       *       *       *       *       *THE SLEEPER  At midnight, in the month of June,  I stand beneath the mystic moon.  An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,  Exhales from out her golden rim,  And, softly dripping, drop by drop,  Upon the quiet mountain top,  Steals drowsily and musically  Into the universal valley.  The rosemary nods upon the grave;  The lily lolls upon the wave;  Wrapping the fog about its breast,  The ruin moulders into rest;  Looking like Lethe, see! the lake  A conscious slumber seems to take,  And would not, for the world, awake.  All Beauty sleeps!--and lo! where lies  (Her casement open to the skies)  Irene, with her Destinies!  Oh, lady bright! can it be right--  This window open to the night!  The wanton airs, from the tree-top,  Laughingly through the lattice-drop--  The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,  Flit through thy chamber in and out,  And wave the curtain canopy  So fitfully--so fearfully--  Above the closed and fringed lid  'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,  That, o'er the floor and down the wall,  Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!  Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?  Why and what art thou dreaming here?  Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,  A wonder to these garden trees!  Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!  Strange, above all, thy length of tress,  And this all-solemn silentness!  The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep  Which is enduring, so be deep!  Heaven have her in its sacred keep!  This chamber changed for one more holy,  This bed for one more melancholy,  I pray to God that she may lie  For ever with unopened eye,  While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!  My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,  As it is lasting, so be deep;  Soft may the worms about her creep!  Far in the forest, dim and old,  For her may some tall vault unfold--  Some vault that oft hath flung its black  And winged panels fluttering back,  Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,  Of her grand family funerals--  Some sepulchre, remote, alone,  Against whose portal she hath thrown,  In childhood many an idle stone--  Some tomb from out whose sounding door  She ne'er shall force an echo more,  Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!  It was the dead who groaned within.1845.       *       *       *       *       *BRIDAL BALLAD.  The ring is on my hand,    And the wreath is on my brow;  Satins and jewels grand  Are all at my command.    And I am happy now.  And my lord he loves me well;    But, when first he breathed his vow,  I felt my bosom swell--  For the words rang as a knell,  And the voice seemed _his_ who fell  In the battle down the dell,    And who is happy now.  But he spoke to reassure me,    And he kissed my pallid brow,  While a reverie came o'er me,  And to the churchyard bore me,  And I sighed to him before me,  Thinking him dead D'Elormie,    \"Oh, I am happy now!\"  And thus the words were spoken,    And thus the plighted vow,  And, though my faith be broken,  And, though my heart be broken,  Behold the golden keys    That _proves_ me happy now!  Would to God I could awaken    For I dream I know not how,  And my soul is sorely shaken  Lest an evil step be taken,--  Lest the dead who is forsaken    May not be happy now.1845.       *       *       *       *       *NOTES.1.   THE RAVEN\"The Raven\" was first published on the 29th January, 1845, in the NewYork 'Evening Mirror'--a paper its author was then assistant editor of.It was prefaced by the following words, understood to have been writtenby N. P. Willis:  \"We are permitted to copy (in advance of publication) from the second  number of the 'American Review', the following remarkable poem by  Edgar Poe. In our opinion, it is the most effective single example of  'fugitive poetry' ever published in this country, and unsurpassed in  English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of  versification, and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and  'pokerishness.' It is one of those 'dainties bred in a book' which we  feed on. It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\"In the February number of the 'American Review' the poem was publishedas by \"Quarles,\" and it was introduced by the following note, evidentlysuggested if not written by Poe himself.  [\"The following lines from a correspondent--besides the deep, quaint  strain of the sentiment, and the curious introduction of some  ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive, as was doubtless  intended by the author--appears to us one of the most felicitous  specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye. The  resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody, measure, and  sound, producing corresponding diversities of effect, have been  thoroughly studied, much more perceived, by very few poets in the  language. While the classic tongues, especially the Greek, possess, by  power of accent, several advantages for versification over our own,  chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet, we have other and  very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme.  Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients  had in common with us. It will be seen that much of the melody of 'The  Raven' arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds  in unusual places. In regard to its measure, it may be noted that if  all the verses were like the second, they might properly be placed  merely in short lines, producing a not uncommon form: but the presence  in all the others of one line--mostly the second in the verse\"  (stanza?)--\"which flows continuously, with only an aspirate pause in  the middle, like that before the short line in the Sapphio Adonic,  while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with  any part beside, gives the versification an entirely different effect.  We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were  better understood.\"  ED. 'Am. Rev.']       *       *       *       *       *2.   THE BELLSThe bibliographical history of \"The Bells\" is curious. The subject, andsome lines of the original version, having been suggested by the poet'sfriend, Mrs. Shew, Poe, when he wrote out the first draft of the poem,headed it, \"The Bells. By Mrs. M. A. Shew.\" This draft, now the editor'sproperty, consists of only seventeen lines, and reads thus:I.      The bells!--ah the bells!      The little silver bells!  How fairy-like a melody there floats          From their throats--          From their merry little throats--          From the silver, tinkling throats    Of the bells, bells, bells--            Of the bells!II.      The bells!--ah, the bells!      The heavy iron bells!  How horrible a monody there floats          From their throats--          From their deep-toned throats--          From their melancholy throats          How I shudder at the notes    Of the bells, bells, bells--            Of the bells!In the autumn of 1848 Poe added another line to this poem, and sent itto the editor of the 'Union Magazine'. It was not published. So, in thefollowing February, the poet forwarded to the same periodical a muchenlarged and altered transcript. Three months having elapsed withoutpublication, another revision of the poem, similar to the currentversion, was sent, and in the following October was published in the'Union Magazine'.       *       *       *       *       *3.   ULALUMEThis poem was first published in Colton's 'American Review' for December1847, as \"To----Ulalume: a Ballad.\" Being reprinted immediately inthe 'Home Journal', it was copied into various publications with thename of the editor, N. P. Willis, appended, and was ascribed to him.When first published, it contained the following additional stanza whichPoe subsequently, at the suggestion of Mrs. Whitman wisely suppressed:  Said we then--the two, then--\"Ah, can it      Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--      The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--  To bar up our path and to ban it      From the secret that lies in these wolds--  Had drawn up the spectre of a planet      From the limbo of lunary souls--  This sinfully scintillant planet      From the Hell of the planetary souls?\"       *       *       *       *       *4.   TO HELEN\"To Helen\" (Mrs. S. Helen Whitman) was not published Until November1848, although written several months earlier. It first appeared in the'Union Magazine' and with the omission, contrary to the knowledge ordesire of Poe, of the line, \"Oh, God! oh, Heaven--how my heart beats incoupling those two words\".       *       *       *       *       *5.   ANNABEL LEE\"Annabel Lee\" was written early in 1849, and is evidently an expressionof the poet's undying love for his deceased bride although at least oneof his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration. Poe sent acopy of the ballad to the 'Union Magazine', in which publication itappeared in January 1850, three months after the author's death. Whilstsuffering from \"hope deferred\" as to its fate, Poe presented a copy of\"Annabel Lee\" to the editor of the 'Southern Literary Messenger', whopublished it in the November number of his periodical, a month afterPoe's death. In the meantime the poet's own copy, left among his papers,passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works, and hequoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York 'Tribune', beforeany one else had an opportunity of publishing it.       *       *       *       *       *6.   A VALENTINE\"A Valentine,\" one of three poems addressed to Mrs. Osgood, appears tohave been written early in 1846.       *       *       *       *       *7.   AN ENIGMA\"An Enigma,\" addressed to Mrs. Sarah Anna Lewig (\"Stella\"), was sent tothat lady in a letter, in November 1847, and the following Marchappeared in Sartain's 'Union Magazine'.*       *       *       *       *8.   TO MY MOTHERThe sonnet, \"To My Mother\" (Maria Clemm), was sent for publication tothe short-lived 'Flag of our Union', early in 1849, but does not appearto have been issued until after its author's death, when it appeared inthe 'Leaflets of Memory' for 1850.*       *       *       *       *9.   FOR ANNIE\"For Annie\" was first published in the 'Flag of our Union', in thespring of 1849. Poe, annoyed at some misprints in this issue, shortlyafterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the 'Home Journal'.*       *       *       *       *10.   TO F----\"To F----\" (Frances Sargeant Osgood) appeared in the 'Broadway Journal'for April 1845. These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed\"To Mary,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for July 1835, andsubsequently republished, with the two stanzas transposed, in 'Graham'sMagazine' for March 1842, as \"To One Departed.\"*       *       *       *       *11.   TO FRANCES S. OSGOOD\"To F--s S. O--d,\" a portion of the poet's triune tribute to Mrs.Osgood, was published in the 'Broadway Journal' for September 1845. Theearliest version of these lines appeared in the 'Southern LiteraryMessenger' for September 1835, as \"Lines written in an Album,\" and wasaddressed to Eliza White, the proprietor's daughter. Slightly revised,the poem reappeared in Burton's 'Gentleman's Magazine' for August, 1839,as \"To----.\"*       *       *       *       *12.   ELDORADOAlthough \"Eldorado\" was published during Poe's lifetime, in 1849, in the'Flag of our Union', it does not appear to have ever received theauthor's finishing touches.*       *       *       *       *13.   EULALIE\"Eulalie--a Song\" first appears in Colton's 'American Review' for July,1845.*       *       *       *       *14.   A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM\"A Dream within a Dream\" does not appear to have been published as aseparate poem during its author's lifetime. A portion of it wascontained, in 1829, in the piece beginning, \"Should my early life seem,\"and in 1831 some few lines of it were used as a conclusion to\"Tamerlane.\" In 1849 the poet sent a friend all but the first nine linesof the piece as a separate poem, headed \"For Annie.\"*       *       *       *       *15   TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)\"To M----L----S----,\" addressed to Mrs. Marie Louise Shew, was writtenin February 1847, and published shortly afterwards. In the firstposthumous collection of Poe's poems these lines were, for some reason,included in the \"Poems written in Youth,\" and amongst those poems theyhave hitherto been included.*       *       *       *       *16.  (2)  TO MARIE LOUISE (SHEW)\"To----,\" a second piece addressed to Mrs. Shew, and written in 1848,was also first published, but in a somewhat faulty form, in the abovenamed posthumous collection.*       *       *       *       *17.   THE CITY IN THE SEAUnder the title of \"The Doomed City\" the initial version of \"The City inthe Sea\" appeared in the 1831 volume of Poems by Poe: it reappeared as\"The City of Sin,\" in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for August 1835,whilst the present draft of it first appeared in Colton's 'AmericanReview' for April, 1845.*       *       *       *       *18.   THE SLEEPERAs \"Irene,\" the earliest known version of \"The Sleeper,\" appeared in the1831 volume. It reappeared in the 'Literary Messenger' for May 1836,and, in its present form, in the 'Broadway Journal' for May 1845.*       *       *       *       *19.   THE BRIDAL BALLAD\"The Bridal Ballad\" is first discoverable in the 'Southern LiteraryMessenger' for January 1837, and, in its present compressed and revisedform, was reprinted in the 'Broadway Journal' for August, 1845.       *       *       *       *       *                         POEMS OF MANHOOD.       *       *       *       *       *LENORE.  Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!  Let the bell toll!--a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river.  And, Guy de Vere, hast _thou_ no tear?--weep now or never more!  See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!  Come! let the burial rite be read--the funeral song be sung!--  An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young--  A dirge for her, the doubly dead in that she died so young.  \"Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,  And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her--that she died!  How _shall_ the ritual, then, be read?--the requiem how be sung  By you--by yours, the evil eye,--by yours, the slanderous tongue  That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?\"  _Peccavimus;_ but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song  Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!  The sweet Lenore hath \"gone before,\" with Hope, that flew beside,  Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride--  For her, the fair and _d\u00e9bonnaire_, that now so lowly lies,  The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes--  The life still there, upon her hair--the death upon her eyes.  \"Avaunt! to-night my heart is light. No dirge will I upraise,  But waft the angel on her flight with a p\u00e6an of old days!  Let _no_ bell toll!--lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,  Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned Earth.  To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven--  From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven--  From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven.\"1844.       *       *       *       *       *TO ONE IN PARADISE,  Thou wast that all to me, love,    For which my soul did pine--  A green isle in the sea, love,    A fountain and a shrine,  All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,  And all the flowers were mine.  Ah, dream too bright to last!    Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise  But to be overcast!    A voice from out the Future cries,  \"On! on!\"--but o'er the Past    (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies  Mute, motionless, aghast!  For, alas! alas! with me    The light of Life is o'er!  \"No more--no more--no more\"--  (Such language holds the solemn sea    To the sands upon the shore)  Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,    Or the stricken eagle soar!  And all my days are trances,    And all my nightly dreams  Are where thy dark eye glances,    And where thy footstep gleams--  In what ethereal dances,    By what eternal streams!  Alas! for that accursed time    They bore thee o'er the billow,  From love to titled age and crime,    And an unholy pillow!  From me, and from our misty clime,    Where weeps the silver willow!1835       *       *       *       *       *THE COLISEUM.  Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary  Of lofty contemplation left to Time  By buried centuries of pomp and power!  At length--at length--after so many days  Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,  (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)  I kneel, an altered and an humble man,  Amid thy shadows, and so drink within  My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!  Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!  Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!  I feel ye now--I feel ye in your strength--  O spells more sure than e'er Jud\u00e6an king  Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!  O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee  Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!  Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!  Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,  A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!  Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair  Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!  Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,  Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,  Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,  The swift and silent lizard of the stones!  But stay! these walls--these ivy-clad arcades--  These mouldering plinths--these sad and blackened shafts--  These vague entablatures--this crumbling frieze--  These shattered cornices--this wreck--this ruin--  These stones--alas! these gray stones--are they all--  All of the famed, and the colossal left  By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?  \"Not all\"--the Echoes answer me--\"not all!  Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever  From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,  As melody from Memnon to the Sun.  We rule the hearts of mightiest men--we rule  With a despotic sway all giant minds.  We are not impotent--we pallid stones.  Not all our power is gone--not all our fame--  Not all the magic of our high renown--  Not all the wonder that encircles us--  Not all the mysteries that in us lie--  Not all the memories that hang upon  And cling around about us as a garment,  Clothing us in a robe of more than glory.\"1838.       *       *       *       *       *THE HAUNTED PALACE.  In the greenest of our valleys    By good angels tenanted,  Once a fair and stately palace--    Radiant palace--reared its head.  In the monarch Thought's dominion--    It stood there!  Never seraph spread a pinion    Over fabric half so fair!  Banners yellow, glorious, golden,    On its roof did float and flow,  (This--all this--was in the olden    Time long ago),  And every gentle air that dallied,    In that sweet day,  Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,    A winged odor went away.  Wanderers in that happy valley,    Through two luminous windows, saw  Spirits moving musically,    To a lute's well-tun\u00ebd law,  Bound about a throne where, sitting    (Porphyrogene!)  In state his glory well befitting,    The ruler of the realm was seen.  And all with pearl and ruby glowing    Was the fair palace door,  Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,    And sparkling evermore,  A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty    Was but to sing,  In voices of surpassing beauty,    The wit and wisdom of their king.  But evil things, in robes of sorrow,    Assailed the monarch's high estate.  (Ah, let us mourn!--for never morrow    Shall dawn upon him desolate !)  And round about his home the glory    That blushed and bloomed,  Is but a dim-remembered story    Of the old time entombed.  And travellers, now, within that valley,    Through the red-litten windows see  Vast forms, that move fantastically    To a discordant melody,    While, like a ghastly rapid river,    Through the pale door  A hideous throng rush out forever    And laugh--but smile no more.1838.       *       *       *       *       *THE CONQUEROR WORM.  Lo! 'tis a gala night    Within the lonesome latter years!  An angel throng, bewinged, bedight    In veils, and drowned in tears,  Sit in a theatre, to see    A play of hopes and fears,  While the orchestra breathes fitfully    The music of the spheres.  Mimes, in the form of God on high,    Mutter and mumble low,  And hither and thither fly--    Mere puppets they, who come and go  At bidding of vast formless things    That shift the scenery to and fro,  Flapping from out their Condor wings    Invisible Wo!  That motley drama--oh, be sure    It shall not be forgot!  With its Phantom chased for evermore,    By a crowd that seize it not,  Through a circle that ever returneth in    To the self-same spot,  And much of Madness, and more of Sin,    And Horror the soul of the plot.  But see, amid the mimic rout    A crawling shape intrude!  A blood-red thing that writhes from out    The scenic solitude!  It writhes!--it writhes!--with mortal pangs    The mimes become its food,  And the angels sob at vermin fangs    In human gore imbued.  Out--out are the lights--out all!    And, over each quivering form,  The curtain, a funeral pall,    Comes down with the rush of a storm,  And the angels, all pallid and wan,    Uprising, unveiling, affirm  That the play is the tragedy, \"Man,\"    And its hero the Conqueror Worm.1838       *       *       *       *       *SILENCE.  There are some qualities--some incorporate things,    That have a double life, which thus is made  A type of that twin entity which springs    From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.  There is a twofold _Silence_--sea and shore--    Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,    Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,  Some human memories and tearful lore,  Render him terrorless: his name's \"No More.\"  He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!    No power hath he of evil in himself;  But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)    Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,  That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod  No foot of man), commend thyself to God!1840       *       *       *       *       *DREAMLAND.  By a route obscure and lonely,  Haunted by ill angels only,  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,  On a black throne reigns upright,  I have reached these lands but newly  From an ultimate dim Thule--  From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,    Out of SPACE--out of TIME.  Bottomless vales and boundless floods,  And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,  With forms that no man can discover  For the dews that drip all over;  Mountains toppling evermore  Into seas without a shore;  Seas that restlessly aspire,  Surging, unto skies of fire;  Lakes that endlessly outspread  Their lone waters--lone and dead,  Their still waters--still and chilly  With the snows of the lolling lily.  By the lakes that thus outspread  Their lone waters, lone and dead,--  Their sad waters, sad and chilly  With the snows of the lolling lily,--  By the mountains--near the river  Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,--  By the gray woods,--by the swamp  Where the toad and the newt encamp,--  By the dismal tarns and pools    Where dwell the Ghouls,--  By each spot the most unholy--  In each nook most melancholy,--  There the traveller meets aghast  Sheeted Memories of the past--  Shrouded forms that start and sigh  As they pass the wanderer by--  White-robed forms of friends long given,  In agony, to the Earth--and Heaven.  For the heart whose woes are legion  'Tis a peaceful, soothing region--  For the spirit that walks in shadow  'Tis--oh, 'tis an Eldorado!  But the traveller, travelling through it,  May not--dare not openly view it;  Never its mysteries are exposed  To the weak human eye unclosed;  So wills its King, who hath forbid  The uplifting of the fringed lid;  And thus the sad Soul that here passes  Beholds it but through darkened glasses.  By a route obscure and lonely,  Haunted by ill angels only.  Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,  On a black throne reigns upright,  I have wandered home but newly  From this ultimate dim Thule.1844       *       *       *       *       *TO ZANTE.  Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,    Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!  How many memories of what radiant hours    At sight of thee and thine at once awake!  How many scenes of what departed bliss!    How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!  How many visions of a maiden that is    No more--no more upon thy verdant slopes!  _No more!_ alas, that magical sad sound    Transforming all! Thy charms shall please _no more_--  Thy memory _no more!_ Accursed ground    Henceforward I hold thy flower-enamelled shore,  O hyacinthine isle! O purple Zante!    \"Isola d'oro! Fior di Levante!\"1887.       *       *       *       *       *HYMN.  At morn--at noon--at twilight dim--  Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!  In joy and wo--in good and ill--  Mother of God, be with me still!  When the Hours flew brightly by,  And not a cloud obscured the sky,  My soul, lest it should truant be,  Thy grace did guide to thine and thee  Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast  Darkly my Present and my Past,  Let my future radiant shine  With sweet hopes of thee and thine!1885.       *       *       *       *       *NOTES.20.   LENORE\"Lenore\" was published, very nearly in its existing shape, in 'ThePioneer' for 1843, but under the title of \"The P\u00e6an\"--now firstpublished in the POEMS OF YOUTH--the germ of it appeared in 1831.*       *       *       *       *21.   TO ONE IN PARADISE\"To One in Paradise\" was included originally in \"The Visionary\" (a talenow known as \"The Assignation\"), in July, 1835, and appeared as aseparate poem entitled \"To Ianthe in Heaven,\" in Burton's 'Gentleman'sMagazine' for July, 1839. The fifth stanza is now added, for the firsttime, to the piece.*       *       *       *       *22.

A few days more, thou knowest, my Alessandra,                  Will make thee mine. Oh, I am very happy!_Aless_.          Methinks thou hast a singular way of showing                  Thy happiness--what ails thee, cousin of mine?                  Why didst thou sigh so deeply?_Cas_.            Did I sigh?                  I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,                  A silly--a most silly fashion I have                  When I am _very_ happy. Did I sigh? (_sighing._)_Aless_.          Thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged                  Too much of late, and I am vexed to see it.                  Late hours and wine, Castiglione,--these                  Will ruin thee! thou art already altered--                  Thy looks are haggard--nothing so wears away                  The constitution as late hours and wine._Cas. (musing_ ). Nothing, fair cousin, nothing--                  Not even deep sorrow--                  Wears it away like evil hours and wine.                  I will amend._Aless_.          Do it! I would have thee drop                  Thy riotous company, too--fellows low born                  Ill suit the like of old Di Broglio's heir                  And Alessandra's husband._Cas_.            I will drop them._Aless_.          Thou wilt--thou must. Attend thou also more                  To thy dress and equipage--they are over plain                  For thy lofty rank and fashion--much depends                  Upon appearances._Cas_.            I'll see to it._Aless_.          Then see to it!--pay more attention, sir,                  To a becoming carriage--much thou wantest                  In dignity._Cas_.

Cousin! fair cousin!--madam!                  I crave thy pardon--indeed I am not well--                  Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.                  This air is most oppressive!--Madam--the Duke!_Enter Di Broglio_._Di Broglio_.     My son, I've news for thee!--hey!                 --what's the matter?          (_observing Alessandra_).                  I' the pouts? Kiss her, Castiglione! kiss her,                  You dog! and make it up, I say, this minute!                  I've news for you both. Politian is expected                  Hourly in Rome--Politian, Earl of Leicester!                  We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit                  To the imperial city._Aless_.          What! Politian                  Of Britain, Earl of Leicester?_Di Brog_.        The same, my love.                  We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young                  In years, but gray in fame. I have not seen him,                  But Rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy                  Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,                  And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding._Aless_.          I have heard much of this Politian.                  Gay, volatile and giddy--is he not,                  And little given to thinking?_Di Brog_.        Far from it, love.                  No branch, they say, of all philosophy                  So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.                  Learned as few are learned._Aless_.          'Tis very strange!                  I have known men have seen Politian                  And sought his company. They speak of him                  As of one who entered madly into life,                  Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs._Cas_.            Ridiculous! Now _I_ have seen Politian                  And know him well--nor learned nor mirthful he.                  He is a dreamer, and shut out                  From common passions._Di Brog_.        Children, we disagree.                  Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air                  Of the garden. Did I dream, or did I hear                  Politian was a _melancholy_ man?

Not that!--I tell thee, holy man,                  Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!                  Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,--                  _I_ have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting                  The deed--the vow--the symbol of the deed--                  And the deed's register should tally, father!         (_draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high_.)                  Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine                  Is written in heaven!_Monk_.           Thy words are madness, daughter,                  And speak a purpose unholy--thy lips are livid--                  Thine eyes are wild--tempt not the wrath divine!

Arouse thee now, Politian!                  Thou must not--nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not                  Give way unto these humors. Be thyself!                  Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee                  And live, for now thou diest!_Politian_.       Not so, Baldazzar!                  _Surely_ I live._Bal_.            Politian, it doth grieve me                  To see thee thus!_Pol_.            Baldazzar, it doth grieve me                  To give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.                  Command me, sir! what wouldst thou have me do?                  At thy behest I will shake off that nature                  Which from my forefathers I did inherit,                  Which with my mother's milk I did imbibe,                  And be no more Politian, but some other.                  Command me, sir!_Bal_.            To the field then--to the field--                  To the senate or the field._Pol_.            Alas! alas!                  There is an imp would follow me even there!                  There is an imp _hath_ followed me even there!                  There is--what voice was that?_Bal_.            I heard it not.                  I heard not any voice except thine own,                  And the echo of thine own._Pol_.            Then I but dreamed._Bal_.            Give not thy soul to dreams: the camp--the court                  Befit thee--Fame awaits thee--Glory calls--                  And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear                  In hearkening to imaginary sounds                  And phantom voices._Pol_.            It _is_ a phantom voice!                  Didst thou not hear it _then_?_Bal_             I heard it not._Pol_.            Thou heardst it not!--Baldazzar, speak no more                  To me, Politian, of thy camps and courts.                  Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,                  Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities                  Of the populous Earth! Bear with me yet awhile                  We have been boys together--school-fellows--                  And now are friends--yet shall not be so long--                  For in the Eternal City thou shalt do me                  A kind and gentle office, and a Power--                  A Power august, benignant, and supreme--                  Shall then absolve thee of all further duties                  Unto thy friend._Bal_.            Thou speakest a fearful riddle                  I _will_ not understand._Pol_.            Yet now as Fate                  Approaches, and the Hours are breathing low,                  The sands of Time are changed to golden grains,                  And dazzle me, Baldazzar. Alas! alas!                  I _cannot_ die, having within my heart                  So keen a relish for the beautiful                  As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air                  Is balmier now than it was wont to be--                  Rich melodies are floating in the winds--                  A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth--                  And with a holier lustre the quiet moon                  Sitteth in Heaven.--Hist! hist! thou canst not say                  Thou hearest not _now_, Baldazzar?_Bal_.            Indeed I hear not._Pol_.            Not hear it!--listen--now--listen!--the faintest sound                  And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!                  A lady's voice!--and sorrow in the tone!                  Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!                  Again!--again!--how solemnly it falls                  Into my heart of hearts! that eloquent voice                  Surely I never heard--yet it were well                  Had I _but_ heard it with its thrilling tones                  In earlier days!_Bal_.            I myself hear it now.                  Be still!--the voice, if I mistake not greatly,                  Proceeds from younder lattice--which you may see                  Very plainly through the window--it belongs,                  Does it not? unto this palace of the Duke.                  The singer is undoubtedly beneath                  The roof of his Excellency--and perhaps                  Is even that Alessandra of whom he spoke                  As the betrothed of Castiglione,                  His son and heir._Pol_.

'Tis strange!--'tis very strange--methought                     the voice                  Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!             (_Approaching the window_)                  Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.                  Now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it Fate,                  Still will I not descend. Baldazzar, make                  Apology unto the Duke for me;                  I go not down to-night._Bal_.            Your lordship's pleasure                  Shall be attended to. Good-night, Politian._Pol_.            Good-night, my friend, good-night.IV.The Gardens of a Palace--Moonlight. LALAGE and POLITIAN._Lalage_.         And dost thou speak of love                  To _me_, Politian?--dost thou speak of love                  To Lalage?--ah woe--ah woe is me!                  This mockery is most cruel--most cruel indeed!_Politian_.       Weep not! oh, sob not thus!--thy bitter tears                  Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, Lalage--                  Be comforted! I know--I know it all,                  And _still_ I speak of love. Look at me, brightest,                  And beautiful Lalage!--turn here thine eyes!                  Thou askest me if I could speak of love,                  Knowing what I know, and seeing what I have seen                  Thou askest me that--and thus I answer thee--                  Thus on my bended knee I answer thee. (_kneeling_.)                  Sweet Lalage, _I love thee_--_love thee_--_love thee_;                  Thro' good and ill--thro' weal and woe, _I love thee_.                  Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,                  Thrills with intenser love than I for thee.                  Not on God's altar, in any time or clime,                  Burned there a holier fire than burneth now                  Within my spirit for _thee_. And do I love?               (_arising_.)                  Even for thy woes I love thee--even for thy woes--                  Thy beauty and thy woes._Lal_.            Alas, proud Earl,                  Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!                  How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens                  Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,                  Could the dishonored Lalage abide?                  Thy wife, and with a tainted memory--                  My seared and blighted name, how would it tally                  With the ancestral honors of thy house,                  And with thy glory?_Pol_.            Speak not to me of glory!                  I hate--I loathe the name; I do abhor                  The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.                  Art thou not Lalage, and I Politian?                  Do I not love--art thou not beautiful--                  What need we more? Ha! glory! now speak not of it:                  By all I hold most sacred and most solemn--                  By all my wishes now--my fears hereafter--                  By all I scorn on earth and hope in heaven--                  There is no deed I would more glory in,                  Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory                  And trample it under foot. What matters it--                  What matters it, my fairest, and my best,                  That we go down unhonored and forgotten                  Into the dust--so we descend together?                  Descend together--and then--and then perchance--_Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?_Pol_.            And then perchance                  _Arise_ together, Lalage, and roam                  The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,                  And still--_Lal_.            Why dost thou pause, Politian?_Pol_.            And still _together_--_together_._Lal_.            Now, Earl of Leicester!                  Thou _lovest_ me, and in my heart of hearts                  I feel thou lovest me truly._Pol_.            O Lalage!               (_throwing himself upon his knee_.)                  And lovest thou _me_?_Lal_.            Hist! hush! within the gloom                  Of yonder trees methought a figure passed--                  A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless--                  Like the grim shadow Conscience, solemn and noiseless.               (_walks across and returns_.)                  I was mistaken--'twas but a giant bough                  Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!_Pol_.            My Lalage--my love! why art thou moved?                  Why dost thou turn so pale? Not Conscience self,                  Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,                  Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind                  Is chilly--and these melancholy boughs                  Throw over all things a gloom._Lal_.            Politian!                  Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land                  With which all tongues are busy--a land new found--                  Miraculously found by one of Genoa--                  A thousand leagues within the golden west?                  A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,--                  And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,                  And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds                  Of Heaven untrammelled flow--which air to breathe                  Is Happiness now, and will be Freedom hereafter                  In days that are to come?_Pol_.            Oh, wilt thou--wilt thou                  Fly to that Paradise--my Lalage, wilt thou                  Fly thither with me? There Care shall be forgotten,                  And Sorrow shall be no more, and Eros be all.                  And life shall then be mine, for I will live                  For thee, and in thine eyes--and thou shalt be                  No more a mourner--but the radiant Joys                  Shall wait upon thee, and the angel Hope                  Attend thee ever; and I will kneel to thee                  And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,                  My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,                  My all;--oh, wilt thou--wilt thou, Lalage,                  Fly thither with me?_Lal_.            A deed is to be done--                  Castiglione lives!_Pol_.            And he shall die!                  (_Exit_.)_Lal_.(_after a pause_). And--he--shall--die!--alas!                  Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?                  Where am I?--what was it he said?--Politian!                  Thou _art_ not gone--thou art not _gone_, Politian!                  I _feel_ thou art not gone--yet dare not look,                  Lest I behold thee not--thou _couldst_ not go                  With those words upon thy lips--oh, speak to me!                  And let me hear thy voice--one word--one word,                  To say thou art not gone,--one little sentence,                  To say how thou dost scorn--how thou dost hate                  My womanly weakness. Ha! ha! thou _art_ not gone--                  Oh, speak to me! I _knew_ thou wouldst not go!                  I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, _durst_ not go.                  Villain, thou _art_ not gone--thou mockest me!                  And thus I clutch thee--thus!--He is gone, he is gone--                  Gone--gone. Where am I?--'tis well--'tis very well!                  So that the blade be keen--the blow be sure,                  'Tis well, 'tis _very_ well--alas! alas!V.The Suburbs. POLITIAN alone._Politian_.       This weakness grows upon me. I am fain                  And much I fear me ill--it will not do                  To die ere I have lived!--Stay--stay thy hand,                  O Azrael, yet awhile!--Prince of the Powers                  Of Darkness and the Tomb, oh, pity me!                  Oh, pity me! let me not perish now,                  In the budding of my Paradisal Hope!                  Give me to live yet--yet a little while:                  'Tis I who pray for life--I who so late                  Demanded but to die!--What sayeth the Count?              _Enter Baldazzar_._Baldazzar_.      That, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud                  Between the Earl Politian and himself,                  He doth decline your cartel._Pol_.            _What_ didst thou say?                  What answer was it you brought me, good Baldazzar?                  With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes                  Laden from yonder bowers!--a fairer day,                  Or one more worthy Italy, methinks                  No mortal eyes have seen!--_what_ said the Count?_Bal_.            That he, Castiglione, not being aware                  Of any feud existing, or any cause                  Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,                  Cannot accept the challenge._Pol_.            It is most true--                  All this is very true. When saw you, sir,                  When saw you now, Baldazzar, in the frigid                  Ungenial Britain which we left so lately,                  A heaven so calm as this--so utterly free                  From the evil taint of clouds?--and he did _say_?_Bal_.            No more, my lord, than I have told you:                  The Count Castiglione will not fight.                  Having no cause for quarrel._Pol_.            Now this is true--                  All very true. Thou art my friend, Baldazzar,                  And I have not forgotten it--thou'lt do me                  A piece of service: wilt thou go back and say                  Unto this man, that I, the Earl of Leicester,                  Hold him a villain?--thus much, I pr'ythee, say                  Unto the Count--it is exceeding just                  He should have cause for quarrel._Bal_.            My lord!--my friend!--_Pol_. (_aside_). 'Tis he--he comes himself!       (_aloud_.) Thou reasonest well.                  I know what thou wouldst say--not send the message--                  Well!--I will think of it--I will not send it.                  Now pr'ythee, leave me--hither doth come a person                  With whom affairs of a most private nature                  I would adjust._Bal_.            I go--to-morrow we meet,                  Do we not?--at the Vatican._Pol_.            At the Vatican.                  (_Exit Bal_.)                  _Enter Castiglione_._Cas_.            The Earl of Leicester here!_Pol_.            I _am_ the Earl of Leicester, and thou seest,                  Dost thou not, that I am here?_Cas_.            My lord, some strange,                  Some singular mistake--misunderstanding--                  Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged                  Thereby, in heat of anger, to address                  Some words most unaccountable, in writing,                  To me, Castiglione; the bearer being                  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. I am aware                  Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,                  Having given thee no offence. Ha!--am I right?                  'Twas a mistake?--undoubtedly--we all                  Do err at times._Pol_.            Draw, villain, and prate no more!_Cas_.            Ha!--draw?--and villain? have at thee then at once,                  Proud Earl!               (_Draws._)_Pol_.(_drawing_.)      Thus to the expiatory tomb,                  Untimely sepulchre, I do devote thee                  In the name of Lalage!_Cas_. (_letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the         stage_.)                  Of Lalage!                  Hold off--thy sacred hand!--avaunt, I say!                  Avaunt--I will not fight thee--indeed I dare not._Pol_.            Thou wilt not fight with me didst say, Sir Count?                  Shall I be baffled thus?--now this is well;                  Didst say thou _darest_ not? Ha!_Cas_.            I dare not--dare not--                  Hold off thy hand--with that beloved name                  So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee--                  I cannot--dare not._Pol_.            Now, by my halidom,                  I do believe thee!--coward, I do believe thee!_Cas_.            Ha!--coward!--this may not be!(_clutches his sword and staggers towards Politian, but his purpose ischanged before reaching him, and he falls upon hia knee at the feet ofthe Earl._)                  Alas! my lord,                  It is--it is--most true. In such a cause                  I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!_Pol.(greatly softened_). Alas!--I do--indeed I pity thee._Cas_.            And Lalage--_Pol_.            _Scoundrel!--arise and die!__Cas_.            It needeth not be--thus--thus--Oh, let me die                  Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting                  That in this deep humiliation I perish.                  For in the fight I will not raise a hand                  Against thee, Earl of Leicester. Strike thou home--               (_baring his bosom_.)                  Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon--                  Strike home. I _will not_ fight thee._Pol_.            Now's Death and Hell!                  Am I not--am I not sorely--grievously tempted                  To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:                  Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare                  For public insult in the streets--before                  The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee--                  Like an avenging spirit I'll follow thee                  Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest--                  Before all Rome I'll taunt thee, villain,--I'll taunt                    thee,                  Dost hear? with _cowardice_--thou _wilt not_ fight me?                  Thou liest! thou _shalt_!                  (_Exit_.)_Cas_.            Now this indeed is just!                  Most righteous, and most just, avenging Heaven![Footnote 1: By Sir Thomas Wyatt.--Ed.]       *       *       *       *       *NOTE ON POLITIAN20. Such portions of \"Politian\" as are known to the public first saw thelight of publicity in the 'Southern Literary Messenger' for December1835 and January 1836, being styled \"Scenes from Politian; anunpublished drama.\" These scenes were included, unaltered, in the 1845collection of Poems by Poe. The larger portion of the original draftsubsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is notconsidered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hastyand unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor;and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance hisreputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, thefollowing fragment from the first scene of Act II. may be offered. TheDuke, it should be premised, is uncle to Alessandra, and father ofCastiglione her betrothed._Duke_.           Why do you laugh?_Castiglione_.    Indeed.                  I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not                  On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl?                  Of the Earl Politian? Yes! it was yesterday.                  Alessandra, you and I, you must remember!                  We were walking in the garden._Duke_.           Perfectly.                  I do remember it--what of it--what then?_Cas_.            O nothing--nothing at all._Duke_.           Nothing at all!                  It is most singular that you should laugh                  At nothing at all!_Cas_.            Most singular--singular!_Duke_.           Look yon, Castiglione, be so kind                  As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.                  What are you talking of?_Cas_.            Was it not so?                  We differed in opinion touching him._Duke_.           Him!--Whom?_Cas_.            Why, sir, the Earl Politian._Duke_.           The Earl of Leicester! Yes!--is it he you mean?                  We differed, indeed. If I now recollect                  The words you used were that the Earl you knew                  Was neither learned nor mirthful._Cas_.            Ha! ha!--now did I?_Duke_.           That did you, sir, and well I knew at the time                  You were wrong, it being not the character                  Of the Earl--whom all the world allows to be                  A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,                  Too positive again._Cas_.            'Tis singular!                  Most singular! I could not think it possible                  So little time could so much alter one!                  To say the truth about an hour ago,                  As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo,                  All arm in arm, we met this very man                  The Earl--he, with his friend Baldazzar,                  Having just arrived in Rome. Ha! ha! he _is_ altered!                  Such an account he gave me of his journey!                  'Twould have made you die with laughter--such tales he                    told                  Of his caprices and his merry freaks                  Along the road--such oddity--such humor--                  Such wit--such whim--such flashes of wild merriment                  Set off too in such full relief by the grave                  Demeanor of his friend--who, to speak the truth                  Was gravity itself--_Duke_.           Did I not tell you?_Cas_.            You did--and yet 'tis strange! but true, as strange,                  How much I was mistaken! I always thought                  The Earl a gloomy man._Duke_.           So, so, you see!                  Be not too positive. Whom have we here?                  It cannot be the Earl?_Cas_.            The Earl! Oh no!                  Tis not the Earl--but yet it is--and leaning                  Upon his friend Baldazzar. Ah! welcome, sir!                  (_Enter Politian and Baldazzar_.)                  My lord, a second welcome let me give you                  To Rome--his Grace the Duke of Broglio.                  Father! this is the Earl Politian, Earl                  Of Leicester in Great Britain.                  [_Politian bows haughtily_.]                  That, his friend                  Baldazzar, Duke of Surrey. The Earl has letters,                  So please you, for Your Grace._Duke_.           Ha! ha! Most welcome                  To Rome and to our palace, Earl Politian!                  And you, most noble Duke! I am glad to see you!                  I knew your father well, my Lord Politian.                  Castiglione! call your cousin hither,                  And let me make the noble Earl acquainted                  With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time                  Most seasonable. The wedding--_Politian_.       Touching those letters, sir,                  Your son made mention of--your son, is he not?--                  Touching those letters, sir, I wot not of them.                  If such there be, my friend Baldazzar here--                  Baldazzar! ah!--my friend Baldazzar here                  Will hand them to Your Grace. I would retire._Duke_.           Retire!--so soon?_Cas_.            What ho! Benito! Rupert!                  His lordship's chambers--show his lordship to them!                  His lordship is unwell.             (_Enter Benito_.)_Ben_.            This way, my lord!             (_Exit, followed by Politian_.)_Duke_.           Retire! Unwell!_Bal_.            So please you, sir. I fear me                  'Tis as you say--his lordship is unwell.                  The damp air of the evening--the fatigue                  Of a long journey--the--indeed I had better                  Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.                  I will return anon._Duke_.           Return anon!                  Now this is very strange! Castiglione!                  This way, my son, I wish to speak with thee.                  You surely were mistaken in what you said                  Of the Earl, mirthful, indeed!--which of us said                  Politian was a melancholy man?

B--.\"WEST POINT, 1831\"DEAR B--...Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a secondedition--that small portion I thought it as well to include in thepresent book as to republish by itself. I have therefore herein combined'Al Aaraaf' and 'Tamerlane' with other poems hitherto unprinted. Norhave I hesitated to insert from the 'Minor Poems,' now omitted, wholelines, and even passages, to the end that being placed in a fairerlight, and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded, theymay have some chance of being seen by posterity.\"It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by onewho is no poet himself. This, according to _your_ idea and _mine_ ofpoetry, I feel to be false--the less poetical the critic, the less justthe critique, and the converse. On this account, and because there arebut few B----s in the world, I would be as much ashamed of the world'sgood opinion as proud of your own. Another than yourself might hereobserve, 'Shakespeare is in possession of the world's good opinion, andyet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets. It appears then that the worldjudge correctly, why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment?'The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word 'judgment' or'opinion.' The opinion is the world's, truly, but it may be calledtheirs as a man would call a book his, having bought it; he did notwrite the book, but it is his; they did not originate the opinion, butit is theirs. A fool, for example, thinks Shakespeare a great poet--yetthe fool has never read Shakespeare. But the fool's neighbor, who is astep higher on the Andes of the mind, whose head (that is to say, hismore exalted thought) is too far above the fool to be seen orunderstood, but whose feet (by which I mean his every-day actions) aresufficiently near to be discerned, and by means of which thatsuperiority is ascertained, which _but_ for them would never have beendiscovered--this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet--thefool believes him, and it is henceforward his _opinion_. This neighbor'sown opinion has, in like manner, been adopted from one above _him_, andso, ascendingly, to a few gifted individuals who kneel around thesummit, beholding, face to face, the master spirit who stands upon thepinnacle.\"You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer.He is read, if at all, in preference to the combined and established witof the world. I say established; for it is with literature as with lawor empire--an established name is an estate in tenure, or a throne inpossession. Besides, one might suppose that books, like their authors,improve by travel--their having crossed the sea is, with us, so great adistinction. Our antiquaries abandon time for distance; our very fopsglance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page, where themystic characters which spell London, Paris, or Genoa, are precisely somany letters of recommendation.\"I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism. I think thenotion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings isanother. I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talentwould be the justice of a critique upon poetry. Therefore a bad poetwould, I grant, make a false critique, and his self-love wouldinfallibly bias his little judgment in his favor; but a poet, who isindeed a poet, could not, I think, fail of making a just critique;whatever should be deducted on the score of self-love might be replacedon account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject; in short, wehave more instances of false criticism than of just where one's ownwritings are the test, simply because we have more bad poets than good.There are, of course, many objections to what I say: Milton is a greatexample of the contrary; but his opinion with respect to the 'ParadiseRegained' is by no means fairly ascertained. By what trivialcircumstances men are often led to assert what they do not reallybelieve! Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity. But, infact, the 'Paradise Regained' is little, if at all, inferior to the'Paradise Lost,' and is only supposed so to be because men do not likeepics, whatever they may say to the contrary, and reading those ofMilton in their natural order, are too much wearied with the first toderive any pleasure from the second.\"I dare say Milton preferred 'Comus' to either--if so--justly.\"As I am speaking of poetry, it will not be amiss to touch slightly uponthe most singular heresy in its modern history--the heresy of what iscalled, very foolishly, the Lake School. Some years ago I might havebeen induced, by an occasion like the present, to attempt a formalrefutation of their doctrine; at present it would be a work ofsupererogation. The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridgeand Southey, but being wise, have laughed at poetical theories soprosaically exemplified.\"Aristotle, with singular assurance, has declared poetry the mostphilosophical of all writings--but it required a Wordsworth to pronounceit the most metaphysical. He seems to think that the end of poetry is,or should be, instruction; yet it is a truism that the end of ourexistence is happiness; if so, the end of every separate part of ourexistence, everything connected with our existence, should be stillhappiness. Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness; andhappiness is another name for pleasure;--therefore the end ofinstruction should be pleasure: yet we see the above-mentioned opinionimplies precisely the reverse.\"To proceed: _ceteris paribus_, he who pleases is of more importance tohis fellow-men than he who instructs, since utility is happiness, andpleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely themeans of obtaining.\"I see no reason, then, why our metaphysical poets should plumethemselves so much on the utility of their works, unless indeed theyrefer to instruction with eternity in view; in which case, sincererespect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt fortheir judgment; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal, sincetheir writings are professedly to be understood by the few, and it isthe many who stand in need of salvation. In such case I should no doubtbe tempted to think of the devil in 'Melmoth,' who labors indefatigably,through three octavo volumes, to accomplish the destruction of one ortwo souls, while any common devil would have demolished one or twothousand.\"Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study--not apassion--it becomes the metaphysician to reason--but the poet toprotest. Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years; the one imbuedin contemplation from his childhood; the other a giant in intellect andlearning. The diffidence, then, with which I venture to dispute theirauthority would be overwhelming did I not feel, from the bottom of myheart, that learning has little to do with the imagination--intellectwith the passions--or age with poetry.  \"'Trifles, like straws, upon the surface flow;  He who would search for pearls must dive below,'\"are lines which have done much mischief. As regards the greater truths,men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top; Truthlies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought--not in the palpablepalaces where she is found. The ancients were not always right in hidingthe goddess in a well; witness the light which Bacon has thrown uponphilosophy; witness the principles of our divine faith--that moralmechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdomof a man.\"We see an instance of Coleridge's liability to err, in his 'BiographiaLiteraria'--professedly his literary life and opinions, but, in fact, atreatise 'de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis'. He goes wrong by reasonof his very profundity, and of his error we have a natural type in thecontemplation of a star. He who regards it directly and intensely sees,it is true, the star, but it is the star without a ray--while he whosurveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star isuseful to us below--its brilliancy and its beauty.\"As to Wordsworth, I have no faith in him. That he had in youth thefeelings of a poet I believe--for there are glimpses of extreme delicacyin his writings--(and delicacy is the poet's own kingdom--his 'ElDorado')--but they have the appearance of a better day recollected; andglimpses, at best, are little evidence of present poetic fire; we knowthat a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of theglacier.\"He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the endof poetizing in his manhood. With the increase of his judgment the lightwhich should make it apparent has faded away. His judgment consequentlyis too correct. This may not be understood,--but the old Goths ofGermany would have understood it, who used to debate matters ofimportance to their State twice, once when drunk, and once whensober--sober that they might not be deficient in formality--drunk lestthey should be destitute of vigor.\"The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us intoadmiration of his poetry, speak very little in his favor: they are fullof such assertions as this (I have opened one of his volumes atrandom)--'Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what isworthy to be done, and what was never done before;'--indeed? then itfollows that in doing what is 'un'worthy to be done, or what 'has' beendone before, no genius can be evinced; yet the picking of pockets is anunworthy act, pockets have been picked time immemorial, and Barrington,the pick-pocket, in point of genius, would have thought hard of acomparison with William Wordsworth, the poet.\"Again, in estimating the merit of certain poems, whether they beOssian's or Macpherson's can surely be of little consequence, yet, inorder to prove their worthlessness, Mr. W. has expended many pages inthe controversy. 'Tant\u00e6ne animis?' Can great minds descend to suchabsurdity? But worse still: that he may bear down every argument infavor of these poems, he triumphantly drags forward a passage, in hisabomination with which he expects the reader to sympathise. It is thebeginning of the epic poem 'Temora.' 'The blue waves of Ullin roll inlight; the green hills are covered with day; trees shake their dustyheads in the breeze.' And this--this gorgeous, yet simple imagery, whereall is alive and panting with immortality--this, William Wordsworth, theauthor of 'Peter Bell,' has 'selected' for his contempt. We shall seewhat better he, in his own person, has to offer. Imprimis:  \"'And now she's at the pony's tail,  And now she's at the pony's head,  On that side now, and now on this;  And, almost stifled with her bliss,  A few sad tears does Betty shed....  She pats the pony, where or when  She knows not ... happy Betty Foy!  Oh, Johnny, never mind the doctor!'\"Secondly:  \"'The dew was falling fast, the--stars began to blink;  I heard a voice: it said,--\"Drink, pretty creature, drink!\"  And, looking o'er the hedge, before me I espied  A snow-white mountain lamb, with a maiden at its side.  No other sheep was near, the lamb was all alone,  And by a slender cord was tether'd to a stone.'\"Now, we have no doubt this is all true: we _will_ believe it,indeed we will, Mr, W. Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite?I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart.\"But there are occasions, dear B----, there are occasions when evenWordsworth is reasonable. Even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end,and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion. Here is anextract from his preface:  \"'Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers,  if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion (_impossible!_)  will, no doubt, have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness; (ha!  ha! ha!) they will look round for poetry (ha! ha! ha! ha!), and will  be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have  been permitted to assume that title.' Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!\"Yet, let not Mr. W. despair; he has given immortality to a wagon, andthe bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe, and dignifieda tragedy with a chorus of turkeys.\"Of Coleridge, I cannot speak but with reverence. His toweringintellect! his gigantic power! To use an author quoted by himself,  '_J'ai trouv\u00e9 souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une  bonne partie de ce qu'elles avancent, mais non pas en ce qu'elles  nient_;'and to employ his own language, he has imprisoned his own conceptions bythe barrier he has erected against those of others. It is lamentable tothink that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics, and, like theNyctanthes, waste its perfume upon the night alone. In reading thatman's poetry, I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano, consciousfrom the very darkness bursting from the crater, of the fire and thelight that are weltering below.\"What is Poetry?--Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as manyappellations as the nine-titled Corcyra! 'Give me,' I demanded of ascholar some time ago, 'give me a definition of poetry.''_Tres-volontiers;_' and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr.Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortalShakespeare! I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye uponthe profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dearB----, think of poetry, and then think of Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think ofall that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous andunwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then--and then thinkof the 'Tempest'--the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'--Prospero--Oberon--andTitania!\"A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, forits _immediate_ object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having, forits object, an _indefinite_ instead of a _definite_ pleasure, being apoem only so far as this object is attained; romance presentingperceptible images with definite, poetry with _in_definite sensations,to which end music is an _essential_, since the comprehension of sweetsound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with apleasurable idea, is poetry; music, without the idea, is simply music;the idea, without the music, is prose, from its very definitiveness.\"What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in hissoul?\"To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B----, what you, no doubt,perceive, for the metaphysical poets as poets, the most sovereigncontempt. That they have followers proves nothing:  \"'No Indian prince has to his palace  More followers than a thief to the gallows.'\"       *       *       *       *       *SONNET--TO SCIENCE.  SCIENCE! true daughter of Old Time thou art!    Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.  Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,    Vulture, whose wings are dull realities  How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,    Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering  To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,    Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing!  Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?    And driven the Hamadryad from the wood  To seek a shelter in some happier star?    Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,  The Elfin from the green grass, and from me  The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?1829.       *       *       *       *       *Private reasons--some of which have reference to the sin of plagiarism,and others to the date of Tennyson's first poems [1]--have induced me,after some hesitation, to republish these, the crude compositions of myearliest boyhood.

O! nothing earthly save the ray  (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,  As in those gardens where the day  Springs from the gems of Circassy--  O! nothing earthly save the thrill  Of melody in woodland rill--  Or (music of the passion-hearted)  Joy's voice so peacefully departed  That like the murmur in the shell,  Its echo dwelleth and will dwell--  O! nothing of the dross of ours--  Yet all the beauty--all the flowers  That list our Love, and deck our bowers--  Adorn yon world afar, afar--  The wandering star.  'Twas a sweet time for Nesace--for there  Her world lay lolling on the golden air,  Near four bright suns--a temporary rest--  An oasis in desert of the blest.  Away away--'mid seas of rays that roll  Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul--  The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)  Can struggle to its destin'd eminence--  To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,  And late to ours, the favour'd one of God--  But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,  She throws aside the sceptre--leaves the helm,  And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,  Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.  Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,  Whence sprang the \"Idea of Beauty\" into birth,  (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,  Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,  It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt),  She look'd into Infinity--and knelt.  Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled--  Fit emblems of the model of her world--  Seen but in beauty--not impeding sight--  Of other beauty glittering thro' the light--  A wreath that twined each starry form around,  And all the opal'd air in color bound.  All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed  Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head  On the fair Capo Deucato [2], and sprang  So eagerly around about to hang  Upon the flying footsteps of--deep pride--  Of her who lov'd a mortal--and so died [3].  The Sephalica, budding with young bees,  Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees:  And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd [4]--  Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd  All other loveliness: its honied dew  (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)  Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,  And fell on gardens of the unforgiven  In Trebizond--and on a sunny flower  So like its own above that, to this hour,  It still remaineth, torturing the bee  With madness, and unwonted reverie:  In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf  And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief  Disconsolate linger--grief that hangs her head,  Repenting follies that full long have fled,  Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,  Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:  Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light  She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:  And Clytia [5] pondering between many a sun,  While pettish tears adown her petals run:  And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth [6]--  And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,  Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing  Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:  And Valisnerian lotus thither flown [7]  From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:  And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante [8]!  Isola d'oro!--Fior di Levante!  And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever [9]  With Indian Cupid down the holy river--  Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given  To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven [10]:    \"Spirit! that dwellest where,      In the deep sky,    The terrible and fair,      In beauty vie!    Beyond the line of blue--      The boundary of the star    Which turneth at the view      Of thy barrier and thy bar--    Of the barrier overgone      By the comets who were cast    From their pride, and from their throne      To be drudges till the last--    To be carriers of fire      (The red fire of their heart)    With speed that may not tire      And with pain that shall not part--    Who livest--_that_ we know--      In Eternity--we feel--    But the shadow of whose brow      What spirit shall reveal?    Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,      Thy messenger hath known    Have dream'd for thy Infinity      A model of their own [11]--    Thy will is done, O God!      The star hath ridden high    Thro' many a tempest, but she rode      Beneath thy burning eye;    And here, in thought, to thee--      In thought that can alone    Ascend thy empire and so be      A partner of thy throne--    By winged Fantasy [12],       My embassy is given,    Till secrecy shall knowledge be      In the environs of Heaven.\"  She ceas'd--and buried then her burning cheek  Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek  A shelter from the fervor of His eye;  For the stars trembled at the Deity.  She stirr'd not--breath'd not--for a voice was there  How solemnly pervading the calm air!  A sound of silence on the startled ear  Which dreamy poets name \"the music of the sphere.\"  Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call  \"Silence\"--which is the merest word of all.  All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things  Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings--  But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high  The eternal voice of God is passing by,  And the red winds are withering in the sky!  \"What tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run [13],  Link'd to a little system, and one sun--  Where all my love is folly, and the crowd  Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,  The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath  (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)  What tho' in worlds which own a single sun  The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,  Yet thine is my resplendency, so given  To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven.  Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,  With all thy train, athwart the moony sky--  Apart--like fire-flies in Sicilian night [14],  And wing to other worlds another light!  Divulge the secrets of thy embassy  To the proud orbs that twinkle--and so be  To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban  Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!\"   Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,  The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight  Our faith to one love--and one moon adore--  The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.  As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,  Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,  And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain  Her way--but left not yet her Theras\u00e6an reign [15].PART II.  High on a mountain of enamell'd head--  Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed  Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,  Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees  With many a mutter'd \"hope to be forgiven\"  What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven--  Of rosy head, that towering far away  Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray  Of sunken suns at eve--at noon of night,  While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light--  Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile  Of gorgeous columns on th' uuburthen'd air,  Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile  Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,  And nursled the young mountain in its lair.  Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall [16]  Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall  Of their own dissolution, while they die--  Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.  A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,  Sat gently on these columns as a crown--  A window of one circular diamond, there,  Look'd out above into the purple air  And rays from God shot down that meteor chain  And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,  Save when, between th' Empyrean and that ring,  Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.  But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen  The dimness of this world: that grayish green  That Nature loves the best for Beauty's grave  Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave--  And every sculptured cherub thereabout  That from his marble dwelling peered out,  Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche--  Achaian statues in a world so rich?  Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis [17]--  From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss  Of beautiful Gomorrah! Oh, the wave [18]  Is now upon thee--but too late to save!  Sound loves to revel in a summer night:  Witness the murmur of the gray twilight  That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco [19],  Of many a wild star-gazer long ago--  That stealeth ever on the ear of him  Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,  And sees the darkness coming as a cloud--  Is not its form--its voice--most palpable and loud?  [20]   But what is this?--it cometh--and it brings  A music with it--'tis the rush of wings--  A pause--and then a sweeping, falling strain,  And Nesace is in her halls again.  From the wild energy of wanton haste  Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;  The zone that clung around her gentle waist  Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.  Within the centre of that hall to breathe  She paus'd and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,  The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair  And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!  Young flowers were whispering in melody [21]  To happy flowers that night--and tree to tree;  Fountains were gushing music as they fell  In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;  Yet silence came upon material things--  Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings--  And sound alone that from the spirit sprang  Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:    \"Neath blue-bell or streamer--      Or tufted wild spray    That keeps, from the dreamer,      The moonbeam away--[22]    Bright beings! that ponder,      With half-closing eyes,    On the stars which your wonder      Hath drawn from the skies,    Till they glance thro' the shade, and      Come down to your brow    Like--eyes of the maiden      Who calls on you now--    Arise! from your dreaming      In violet bowers,    To duty beseeming      These star-litten hours--    And shake from your tresses      Encumber'd with dew    The breath of those kisses      That cumber them too--    (O! how, without you, Love!      Could angels be blest?)    Those kisses of true love      That lull'd ye to rest!    Up! shake from your wing      Each hindering thing:    The dew of the night--      It would weigh down your flight;    And true love caresses--      O! leave them apart!    They are light on the tresses,      But lead on the heart.    Ligeia! Ligeia!      My beautiful one!    Whose harshest idea      Will to melody run,    O! is it thy will      On the breezes to toss?    Or, capriciously still,      Like the lone Albatross, [23]    Incumbent on night      (As she on the air)    To keep watch with delight      On the harmony there?    Ligeia! wherever      Thy image may be,    No magic shall sever      Thy music from thee.    Thou hast bound many eyes      In a dreamy sleep--    But the strains still arise      Which _thy_ vigilance keep--    The sound of the rain      Which leaps down to the flower,    And dances again      In the rhythm of the shower--    The murmur that springs [24]      From the growing of grass    Are the music of things--      But are modell'd, alas!    Away, then, my dearest,      O! hie thee away    To springs that lie clearest      Beneath the moon-ray--    To lone lake that smiles,      In its dream of deep rest,    At the many star-isles    That enjewel its breast--    Where wild flowers, creeping,      Have mingled their shade,    On its margin is sleeping      Full many a maid--    Some have left the cool glade, and      Have slept with the bee--[25]    Arouse them, my maiden,      On moorland and lea--    Go! breathe on their slumber,      All softly in ear,    The musical number      They slumber'd to hear--    For what can awaken      An angel so soon    Whose sleep hath been taken      Beneath the cold moon,    As the spell which no slumber      Of witchery may test,    The rhythmical number      Which lull'd him to rest?\"  Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,  A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',  Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight--  Seraphs in all but \"Knowledge,\" the keen light  That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,  O death! from eye of God upon that star;  Sweet was that error--sweeter still that death--  Sweet was that error--ev'n with _us_ the breath  Of Science dims the mirror of our joy--  To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy--  For what (to them) availeth it to know  That Truth is Falsehood--or that Bliss is Woe?  Sweet was their death--with them to die was rife  With the last ecstasy of satiate life--  Beyond that death no immortality--  But sleep that pondereth and is not \"to be\"--  And there--oh! may my weary spirit dwell--  Apart from Heaven's Eternity--and yet how far from Hell! [26]  What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim  Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?  But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts  To those who hear not for their beating hearts.  A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover--  O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)  Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?  Unguided Love hath fallen--'mid \"tears of perfect moan.\" [27]  He was a goodly spirit--he who fell:  A wanderer by mossy-mantled well--  A gazer on the lights that shine above--  A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:  What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,  And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair--  And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy  To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.  The night had found (to him a night of wo)  Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo--  Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,  And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.  Here sate he with his love--his dark eye bent  With eagle gaze along the firmament:  Now turn'd it upon her--but ever then  It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.  \"Ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray!  How lovely 'tis to look so far away!  She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve  I left her gorgeous halls--nor mourned to leave,  That eve--that eve--I should remember well--  The sun-ray dropped, in Lemnos with a spell  On th' Arabesque carving of a gilded hall  Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall--  And on my eyelids--O, the heavy light!  How drowsily it weighed them into night!  On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran  With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:  But O, that light!--I slumbered--Death, the while,  Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle  So softly that no single silken hair  Awoke that slept--or knew that he was there.  \"The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon  Was a proud temple called the Parthenon; [28]  More beauty clung around her columned wall  Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal, [29]  And when old Time my wing did disenthral  Thence sprang I--as the eagle from his tower,  And years I left behind me in an hour.  What time upon her airy bounds I hung,  One half the garden of her globe was flung  Unrolling as a chart unto my view--  Tenantless cities of the desert too!  Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,  And half I wished to be again of men.\"  \"My Angelo! and why of them to be?  A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee--  And greener fields than in yon world above,  And woman's loveliness--and passionate love.\"  \"But list, Ianthe! when the air so soft  Failed, as my pennoned spirit leapt aloft, [30]  Perhaps my brain grew dizzy--but the world  I left so late was into chaos hurled,  Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,  And rolled a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.  Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar,  And fell--not swiftly as I rose before,  But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'  Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!  Nor long the measure of my falling hours,  For nearest of all stars was thine to ours--  Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,  A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.\"  \"We came--and to thy Earth--but not to us  Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:  We came, my love; around, above, below,  Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,  Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod  _She_ grants to us as granted by her God--  But, Angelo, than thine gray Time unfurled  Never his fairy wing o'er fairer world!  Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes  Alone could see the phantom in the skies,  When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be  Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea--  But when its glory swelled upon the sky,  As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,  We paused before the heritage of men,  And thy star trembled--as doth Beauty then!\"  Thus in discourse, the lovers whiled away  The night that waned and waned and brought no day.  They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts  Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.1839.[Footnote 1: A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appearedsuddenly in the heavens--attained, in a few days, a brilliancysurpassing that of Jupiter--then as suddenly disappeared, and has neverbeen seen since.][Footnote 2: On Santa Maura--olim Deucadia.][Footnote 3: Sappho.][Footnote 4: This flower is much noticed by Lewenhoeck and Tournefort.The bee, feeding upon its blossom, becomes intoxicated.][Footnote: Clytia--the Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, or, to employ abetter-known term, the turnsol--which turns continually towards the sun,covers itself, like Peru, the country from which it comes, with dewyclouds which cool and refresh its flowers during the most violent heatof the day.--'B. de St. Pierre.'][Footnote 6: There is cultivated in the king's garden at Paris, aspecies of serpentine aloe without prickles, whose large and beautifulflower exhales a strong odor of the vanilla, during the time of itsexpansion, which is very short.

Kind solace in a dying hour!  Such, father, is not (now) my theme--  I will not madly deem that power  Of Earth may shrive me of the sin  Unearthly pride hath revelled in--  I have no time to dote or dream:  You call it hope--that fire of fire!  It is but agony of desire:  If I _can_ hope--O God! I can--  Its fount is holier--more divine--  I would not call thee fool, old man,  But such is not a gift of thine.  Know thou the secret of a spirit  Bowed from its wild pride into shame  O yearning heart! I did inherit  Thy withering portion with the fame,  The searing glory which hath shone  Amid the Jewels of my throne,  Halo of Hell! and with a pain  Not Hell shall make me fear again--  O craving heart, for the lost flowers  And sunshine of my summer hours!  The undying voice of that dead time,  With its interminable chime,  Rings, in the spirit of a spell,  Upon thy emptiness--a knell.  I have not always been as now:  The fevered diadem on my brow  I claimed and won usurpingly--  Hath not the same fierce heirdom given  Rome to the C\u00e6sar--this to me?  The heritage of a kingly mind,  And a proud spirit which hath striven  Triumphantly with human kind.  On mountain soil I first drew life:  The mists of the Taglay have shed  Nightly their dews upon my head,  And, I believe, the winged strife  And tumult of the headlong air  Have nestled in my very hair.  So late from Heaven--that dew--it fell  ('Mid dreams of an unholy night)  Upon me with the touch of Hell,  While the red flashing of the light  From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,  Appeared to my half-closing eye  The pageantry of monarchy;  And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar  Came hurriedly upon me, telling  Of human battle, where my voice,  My own voice, silly child!--was swelling  (O! how my spirit would rejoice,  And leap within me at the cry)  The battle-cry of Victory!  The rain came down upon my head  Unsheltered--and the heavy wind  Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.  It was but man, I thought, who shed  Laurels upon me: and the rush--  The torrent of the chilly air  Gurgled within my ear the crush  Of empires--with the captive's prayer--  The hum of suitors--and the tone  Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.  My passions, from that hapless hour,  Usurped a tyranny which men  Have deemed since I have reached to power,  My innate nature--be it so:  But, father, there lived one who, then,  Then--in my boyhood--when their fire  Burned with a still intenser glow  (For passion must, with youth, expire)  E'en _then_ who knew this iron heart  In woman's weakness had a part.  I have no words--alas!--to tell  The loveliness of loving well!  Nor would I now attempt to trace  The more than beauty of a face  Whose lineaments, upon my mind,  Are--shadows on th' unstable wind:  Thus I remember having dwelt  Some page of early lore upon,  With loitering eye, till I have felt  The letters--with their meaning--melt  To fantasies--with none.  O, she was worthy of all love!  Love as in infancy was mine--  'Twas such as angel minds above  Might envy; her young heart the shrine  On which my every hope and thought  Were incense--then a goodly gift,  For they were childish and upright--  Pure--as her young example taught:  Why did I leave it, and, adrift,  Trust to the fire within, for light?  We grew in age--and love--together--  Roaming the forest, and the wild;  My breast her shield in wintry weather--  And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.  And she would mark the opening skies,  _I_ saw no Heaven--but in her eyes.  Young Love's first lesson is----the heart:  For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,  When, from our little cares apart,  And laughing at her girlish wiles,  I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,  And pour my spirit out in tears--  There was no need to speak the rest--  No need to quiet any fears  Of her--who asked no reason why,  But turned on me her quiet eye!  Yet _more_ than worthy of the love  My spirit struggled with, and strove  When, on the mountain peak, alone,  Ambition lent it a new tone--  I had no being--but in thee:  The world, and all it did contain  In the earth--the air--the sea--  Its joy--its little lot of pain  That was new pleasure--the ideal,  Dim, vanities of dreams by night--  And dimmer nothings which were real--  (Shadows--and a more shadowy light!)  Parted upon their misty wings,  And, so, confusedly, became  Thine image and--a name--a name!  Two separate--yet most intimate things.  I was ambitious--have you known  The passion, father? You have not:  A cottager, I marked a throne  Of half the world as all my own,  And murmured at such lowly lot--  But, just like any other dream,  Upon the vapor of the dew  My own had past, did not the beam  Of beauty which did while it thro'  The minute--the hour--the day--oppress  My mind with double loveliness.  We walked together on the crown  Of a high mountain which looked down  Afar from its proud natural towers  Of rock and forest, on the hills--  The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers  And shouting with a thousand rills.  I spoke to her of power and pride,  But mystically--in such guise  That she might deem it nought beside  The moment's converse; in her eyes  I read, perhaps too carelessly--  A mingled feeling with my own--  The flush on her bright cheek, to me  Seemed to become a queenly throne  Too well that I should let it be  Light in the wilderness alone.  I wrapped myself in grandeur then,  And donned a visionary crown--  Yet it was not that Fantasy  Had thrown her mantle over me--  But that, among the rabble--men,  Lion ambition is chained down--  And crouches to a keeper's hand--  Not so in deserts where the grand--  The wild--the terrible conspire  With their own breath to fan his fire.  Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!--  Is she not queen of Earth? her pride  Above all cities? in her hand  Their destinies? in all beside  Of glory which the world hath known  Stands she not nobly and alone?  Falling--her veriest stepping-stone  Shall form the pedestal of a throne--  And who her sovereign? Timour--he  Whom the astonished people saw  Striding o'er empires haughtily  A diademed outlaw!  O, human love! thou spirit given,  On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!  Which fall'st into the soul like rain  Upon the Siroc-withered plain,  And, failing in thy power to bless,  But leav'st the heart a wilderness!  Idea! which bindest life around  With music of so strange a sound  And beauty of so wild a birth--  Farewell! for I have won the Earth.  When Hope, the eagle that towered, could see  No cliff beyond him in the sky,  His pinions were bent droopingly--  And homeward turned his softened eye.  'Twas sunset: When the sun will part  There comes a sullenness of heart  To him who still would look upon  The glory of the summer sun.  That soul will hate the ev'ning mist  So often lovely, and will list  To the sound of the coming darkness (known  To those whose spirits hearken) as one  Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly,  But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.  What tho' the moon--tho' the white moon  Shed all the splendor of her noon,  _Her_ smile is chilly--and _her_ beam,  In that time of dreariness, will seem  (So like you gather in your breath)  A portrait taken after death.  And boyhood is a summer sun  Whose waning is the dreariest one--  For all we live to know is known,  And all we seek to keep hath flown--  Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall  With the noon-day beauty--which is all.  I reached my home--my home no more--  For all had flown who made it so.  I passed from out its mossy door,  And, tho' my tread was soft and low,  A voice came from the threshold stone  Of one whom I had earlier known--  O, I defy thee, Hell, to show  On beds of fire that burn below,  An humbler heart--a deeper woe.  Father, I firmly do believe--  I _know_--for Death who comes for me  From regions of the blest afar,  Where there is nothing to deceive,  Hath left his iron gate ajar.  And rays of truth you cannot see  Are flashing thro' Eternity----  I do believe that Eblis hath  A snare in every human path--  Else how, when in the holy grove  I wandered of the idol, Love,--  Who daily scents his snowy wings  With incense of burnt-offerings  From the most unpolluted things,  Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven  Above with trellised rays from Heaven  No mote may shun--no tiniest fly--  The light'ning of his eagle eye--  How was it that Ambition crept,  Unseen, amid the revels there,  Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt  In the tangles of Love's very hair!1829.       *       *       *       *       *TO HELEN.  Helen, thy beauty is to me    Like those Nicean barks of yore,  That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,    The weary, wayworn wanderer bore    To his own native shore.  On desperate seas long wont to roam,    Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,  Thy Naiad airs have brought me home    To the glory that was Greece,  To the grandeur that was Rome.  Lo! in yon brilliant window niche,    How statue-like I see thee stand,    The agate lamp within thy hand!  Ah, Psyche, from the regions which    Are Holy Land!1831.       *       *       *       *       *THE VALLEY OF UNREST.  _Once_ it smiled a silent dell  Where the people did not dwell;  They had gone unto the wars,  Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,  Nightly, from their azure towers,  To keep watch above the flowers,  In the midst of which all day  The red sun-light lazily lay,  _Now_ each visitor shall confess  The sad valley's restlessness.  Nothing there is motionless--  Nothing save the airs that brood  Over the magic solitude.  Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees  That palpitate like the chill seas  Around the misty Hebrides!  Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven  That rustle through the unquiet Heaven  Unceasingly, from morn till even,  Over the violets there that lie  In myriad types of the human eye--  Over the lilies that wave  And weep above a nameless grave!  They wave:--from out their fragrant tops  Eternal dews come down in drops.  They weep:--from off their delicate stems  Perennial tears descend in gems.1831.       *       *       *       *       *ISRAFEL. [1]  In Heaven a spirit doth dwell    \"Whose heart-strings are a lute;\"  None sing so wildly well  As the angel Israfel,  And the giddy Stars (so legends tell),  Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell    Of his voice, all mute.  Tottering above    In her highest noon,    The enamoured Moon  Blushes with love,    While, to listen, the red levin    (With the rapid Pleiads, even,    Which were seven),    Pauses in Heaven.  And they say (the starry choir    And the other listening things)  That Israfeli's fire  Is owing to that lyre    By which he sits and sings--  The trembling living wire  Of those unusual strings.  But the skies that angel trod,    Where deep thoughts are a duty--  Where Love's a grow-up God--    Where the Houri glances are  Imbued with all the beauty    Which we worship in a star.  Therefore, thou art not wrong,    Israfeli, who despisest  An unimpassioned song;  To thee the laurels belong,    Best bard, because the wisest!  Merrily live and long!  The ecstasies above    With thy burning measures suit--  Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,    With the fervor of thy lute--    Well may the stars be mute!  Yes, Heaven is thine; but this    Is a world of sweets and sours;    Our flowers are merely--flowers,  And the shadow of thy perfect bliss    Is the sunshine of ours.  If I could dwell  Where Israfel    Hath dwelt, and he where I,  He might not sing so wildly well    A mortal melody,  While a bolder note than this might swell    From my lyre within the sky.1836.[Footnote 1:  And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lute, and who has the  sweetest voice of all God's creatures.'Koran'.]       *       *       *       *       *TO----  I heed not that my earthly lot    Hath--little of Earth in it--  That years of love have been forgot    In the hatred of a minute:--  I mourn not that the desolate    Are happier, sweet, than I,  But that _you_ sorrow for _my_ fate    Who am a passer-by.1829.       *       *       *       *       *TO----  The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see    The wantonest singing birds,  Are lips--and all thy melody    Of lip-begotten words--  Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined    Then desolately fall,  O God! on my funereal mind    Like starlight on a pall--  Thy heart--_thy_ heart!--I wake and sigh,    And sleep to dream till day  Of the truth that gold can never buy--    Of the baubles that it may.1829.       *       *       *       *       *TO THE RIVER  Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow    Of crystal, wandering water,  Thou art an emblem of the glow        Of beauty--the unhidden heart--        The playful maziness of art    In old Alberto's daughter;  But when within thy wave she looks--    Which glistens then, and trembles--  Why, then, the prettiest of brooks    Her worshipper resembles;  For in his heart, as in thy stream,    Her image deeply lies--  His heart which trembles at the beam    Of her soul-searching eyes.1829.       *       *       *       *       *SONG.  I saw thee on thy bridal day--    When a burning blush came o'er thee,  Though happiness around thee lay,    The world all love before thee:  And in thine eye a kindling light    (Whatever it might be)  Was all on Earth my aching sight    Of Loveliness could see.  That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame--    As such it well may pass--  Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame    In the breast of him, alas!  Who saw thee on that bridal day,    When that deep blush _would_ come o'er thee,  Though happiness around thee lay,    The world all love before thee.1827.       *       *       *       *       *SPIRITS OF THE DEAD.  Thy soul shall find itself alone  'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone  Not one, of all the crowd, to pry  Into thine hour of secrecy.  Be silent in that solitude    Which is not loneliness--for then  The spirits of the dead who stood    In life before thee are again  In death around thee--and their will  Shall overshadow thee: be still.  The night--tho' clear--shall frown--  And the stars shall not look down  From their high thrones in the Heaven,  With light like Hope to mortals given--  But their red orbs, without beam,  To thy weariness shall seem  As a burning and a fever  Which would cling to thee forever.  Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish--  Now are visions ne'er to vanish--  From thy spirit shall they pass  No more--like dew-drops from the grass.  The breeze--the breath of God--is still--  And the mist upon the hill  Shadowy--shadowy--yet unbroken,    Is a symbol and a token--    How it hangs upon the trees,    A mystery of mysteries!1837.       *       *       *       *       *A DREAM.  In visions of the dark night    I have dreamed of joy departed--  But a waking dream of life and light    Hath left me broken-hearted.  Ah! what is not a dream by day    To him whose eyes are cast  On things around him with a ray    Turned back upon the past?  That holy dream--that holy dream,    While all the world were chiding,  Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,    A lonely spirit guiding.  What though that light, thro' storm and night,    So trembled from afar--  What could there be more purely bright    In Truth's day star?1837.       *       *       *       *       *ROMANCE.  Romance, who loves to nod and sing,  With drowsy head and folded wing,  Among the green leaves as they shake  Far down within some shadowy lake,  To me a painted paroquet  Hath been--a most familiar bird--  Taught me my alphabet to say--  To lisp my very earliest word  While in the wild wood I did lie,  A child--with a most knowing eye.  Of late, eternal Condor years  So shake the very Heaven on high  With tumult as they thunder by,  I have no time for idle cares  Though gazing on the unquiet sky.  And when an hour with calmer wings  Its down upon my spirit flings--  That little time with lyre and rhyme  To while away--forbidden things!  My heart would feel to be a crime  Unless it trembled with the strings.1829.       *       *       *       *       *FAIRYLAND.  Dim vales--and shadowy floods--  And cloudy-looking woods,  Whose forms we can't discover  For the tears that drip all over  Huge moons there wax and wane--  Again--again--again--  Every moment of the night--  Forever changing places--  And they put out the star-light  With the breath from their pale faces.  About twelve by the moon-dial  One more filmy than the rest  (A kind which, upon trial,  They have found to be the best)  Comes down--still down--and down  With its centre on the crown  Of a mountain's eminence,  While its wide circumference  In easy drapery falls  Over hamlets, over halls,  Wherever they may be--  O'er the strange woods--o'er the sea--  Over spirits on the wing--  Over every drowsy thing--  And buries them up quite  In a labyrinth of light--  And then, how deep!--O, deep!  Is the passion of their sleep.  In the morning they arise,  And their moony covering  Is soaring in the skies,  With the tempests as they toss,  Like--almost any thing--  Or a yellow Albatross.  They use that moon no more  For the same end as before--  Videlicet a tent--  Which I think extravagant:  Its atomies, however,  Into a shower dissever,  Of which those butterflies,  Of Earth, who seek the skies,  And so come down again  (Never-contented thing!)  Have brought a specimen  Upon their quivering wings.1831       *       *       *       *       *THE LAKE.  In spring of youth it was my lot  To haunt of the wide world a spot  The which I could not love the less--  So lovely was the loneliness  Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,  And the tall pines that towered around.  But when the Night had thrown her pall  Upon the spot, as upon all,  And the mystic wind went by  Murmuring in melody--  Then--ah, then, I would awake  To the terror of the lone lake.  Yet that terror was not fright,  But a tremulous delight--  A feeling not the jewelled mine  Could teach or bribe me to define--  Nor Love--although the Love were thine.  Death was in that poisonous wave,  And in its gulf a fitting grave  For him who thence could solace bring  To his lone imagining--  Whose solitary soul could make  An Eden of that dim lake.1827.       *       *       *       *       *EVENING STAR.  'Twas noontide of summer,    And midtime of night,  And stars, in their orbits,    Shone pale, through the light  Of the brighter, cold moon.    'Mid planets her slaves,  Herself in the Heavens,    Her beam on the waves.    I gazed awhile    On her cold smile;  Too cold--too cold for me--    There passed, as a shroud,    A fleecy cloud,  And I turned away to thee,    Proud Evening Star,    In thy glory afar  And dearer thy beam shall be;    For joy to my heart    Is the proud part  Thou bearest in Heaven at night,    And more I admire    Thy distant fire,  Than that colder, lowly light.1827.       *       *       *       *       *IMITATION.  A dark unfathomed tide  Of interminable pride--  A mystery, and a dream,  Should my early life seem;  I say that dream was fraught  With a wild and waking thought  Of beings that have been,  Which my spirit hath not seen,  Had I let them pass me by,  With a dreaming eye!  Let none of earth inherit  That vision on my spirit;  Those thoughts I would control,  As a spell upon his soul:  For that bright hope at last  And that light time have past,  And my wordly rest hath gone  With a sigh as it passed on:  I care not though it perish  With a thought I then did cherish.1827.       *       *       *       *       *\"THE HAPPIEST DAY.\"     I.       The happiest day--the happiest hour                My seared and blighted heart hath known,              The highest hope of pride and power,                I feel hath flown.     II.      Of power! said I? Yes! such I ween                But they have vanished long, alas!              The visions of my youth have been--                But let them pass.     III.     And pride, what have I now with thee?                Another brow may ev'n inherit              The venom thou hast poured on me--                Be still my spirit!     IV.      The happiest day--the happiest hour                Mine eyes shall see--have ever seen              The brightest glance of pride and power                I feel have been:     V.       But were that hope of pride and power                Now offered with the pain              Ev'n _then_ I felt--that brightest hour                I would not live again:     VI.      For on its wing was dark alloy                And as it fluttered--fell              An essence--powerful to destroy                A soul that knew it well.1827.       *       *       *       *       *Translation from the Greek.HYMN TO ARISTOGEITON AND HARMODIUS.  I.      Wreathed in myrtle, my sword I'll conceal,            Like those champions devoted and brave,          When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,            And to Athens deliverance gave.  II.     Beloved heroes! your deathless souls roam            In the joy breathing isles of the blest;          Where the mighty of old have their home--            Where Achilles and Diomed rest.  III.    In fresh myrtle my blade I'll entwine,            Like Harmodius, the gallant and good,          When he made at the tutelar shrine            A libation of Tyranny's blood.  IV.     Ye deliverers of Athens from shame!            Ye avengers of Liberty's wrongs!          Endless ages shall cherish your fame,            Embalmed in their echoing songs!1827       *       *       *       *       *DREAMS.  Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!  My spirit not awakening, till the beam  Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.  Yes! though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,  'Twere better than the cold reality  Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,  And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,  A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.  But should it be--that dream eternally  Continuing--as dreams have been to me  In my young boyhood--should it thus be given,  'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.  For I have revelled when the sun was bright  I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light  And loveliness,--have left my very heart  Inclines of my imaginary apart [1]  From mine own home, with beings that have been  Of mine own thought--what more could I have seen?  'Twas once--and only once--and the wild hour  From my remembrance shall not pass--some power  Or spell had bound me--'twas the chilly wind  Came o'er me in the night, and left behind  Its image on my spirit--or the moon  Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon  Too coldly--or the stars--howe'er it was  That dream was that that night-wind--let it pass.  _I have been_ happy, though in a dream.  I have been happy--and I love the theme:  Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life  As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife  Of semblance with reality which brings  To the delirious eye, more lovely things  Of Paradise and Love--and all my own!--  Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.[Footnote 1: In climes of mine imagining apart?--Ed.]       *       *       *       *       *\"IN YOUTH I HAVE KNOWN ONE.\"          _How often we forget all time, when lone          Admiring Nature's universal throne;          Her woods--her wilds--her mountains--the intense          Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!_I.        In youth I have known one with whom the Earth            In secret communing held--as he with it,          In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:            Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit          From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth            A passionate light such for his spirit was fit--          And yet that spirit knew--not in the hour            Of its own fervor--what had o'er it power.II.       Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought            To a ferver [1] by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,          But I will half believe that wild light fraught            With more of sovereignty than ancient lore          Hath ever told--or is it of a thought            The unembodied essence, and no more          That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass            As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?III.      Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye            To the loved object--so the tear to the lid          Will start, which lately slept in apathy?            And yet it need not be--(that object) hid          From us in life--but common--which doth lie            Each hour before us--but then only bid          With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken            T' awake us--'Tis a symbol and a token--IV.       Of what in other worlds shall be--and given            In beauty by our God, to those alone          Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven            Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,          That high tone of the spirit which hath striven            Though not with Faith--with godliness--whose throne          With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;            Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.[Footnote 1: Query \"fervor\"?--Ed.]       *       *       *       *       *A P\u00c6AN.I.        How shall the burial rite be read?            The solemn song be sung?          The requiem for the loveliest dead,            That ever died so young?II.       Her friends are gazing on her,            And on her gaudy bier,          And weep!--oh! to dishonor            Dead beauty with a tear!III.     They loved her for her wealth--           And they hated her for her pride--          But she grew in feeble health,            And they _love_ her--that she died.IV.      They tell me (while they speak           Of her \"costly broider'd pall\")         That my voice is growing weak--           That I should not sing at all--V.       Or that my tone should be           Tun'd to such solemn song         So mournfully--so mournfully,           That the dead may feel no wrong.VI.      But she is gone above,           With young Hope at her side,         And I am drunk with love           Of the dead, who is my bride.--VII.     Of the dead--dead who lies           All perfum'd there,         With the death upon her eyes.           And the life upon her hair.VIII.    Thus on the coffin loud and long           I strike--the murmur sent         Through the gray chambers to my song,           Shall be the accompaniment.IX.      Thou diedst in thy life's June--           But thou didst not die too fair:         Thou didst not die too soon,           Nor with too calm an air.X.       From more than friends on earth,           Thy life and love are riven,         To join the untainted mirth           Of more than thrones in heaven.--XI.      Therefore, to thee this night           I will no requiem raise,         But waft thee on thy flight,           With a P\u00e6an of old days.       *       *       *       *       *NOTES.30. On the \"Poems written in Youth\" little comment is needed. Thissection includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 (whichwas subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and secondpublished volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given intheir revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.\"Al Aaraaf\" first appeared, with the sonnet \"To Silence\" prefixed to it,in 1829, and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for1831, however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by thefollowing twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequentcollections:AL AARAAF.  Mysterious star!  Thou wert my dream  All a long summer night--  Be now my theme!  By this clear stream,  Of thee will I write;  Meantime from afar  Bathe me in light!  Thy world has not the dross of ours,  Yet all the beauty--all the flowers  That list our love or deck our bowers  In dreamy gardens, where do lie  Dreamy maidens all the day;  While the silver winds of Circassy  On violet couches faint away.  Little--oh! little dwells in thee  Like unto what on earth we see:  Beauty's eye is here the bluest  In the falsest and untruest--  On the sweetest air doth float  The most sad and solemn note--  If with thee be broken hearts,  Joy so peacefully departs,  That its echo still doth dwell,  Like the murmur in the shell.  Thou! thy truest type of grief  Is the gently falling leaf--  Thou! thy framing is so holy  Sorrow is not melancholy.       *       *       *       *       *31. The earliest version of \"Tamerlane\" was included in the suppressedvolume of 1827, but differs very considerably from the poem as nowpublished. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations andimprovements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, thelines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye atleast.       *       *       *       *       *32. \"To Helen\" first appeared in the 1831 volume, as did also \"TheValley of Unrest\" (as \"The Valley Nis\"), \"Israfel,\" and one or twoothers of the youthful pieces.The poem styled \"Romance\" constituted the Preface of the 1829 volume,but with the addition of the following lines:  Succeeding years, too wild for song,  Then rolled like tropic storms along,  Where, though the garish lights that fly  Dying along the troubled sky,  Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,  The blackness of the general Heaven,  That very blackness yet doth fling  Light on the lightning's silver wing.  For being an idle boy lang syne,  Who read Anacreon and drank wine,  I early found Anacreon rhymes  Were almost passionate sometimes--  And by strange alchemy of brain  His pleasures always turned to pain--  His na\u00efvet\u00e9 to wild desire--  His wit to love--his wine to fire--  And so, being young and dipt in folly,  I fell in love with melancholy.  And used to throw my earthly rest  And quiet all away in jest--  I could not love except where Death  Was mingling his with Beauty's breath--  Or Hymen, Time, and Destiny,  Were stalking between her and me.       *       *       *       *       *  But _now_ my soul hath too much room--  Gone are the glory and the gloom--  The black hath mellow'd into gray,  And all the fires are fading away.  My draught of passion hath been deep--  I revell'd, and I now would sleep--  And after drunkenness of soul  Succeeds the glories of the bowl--  An idle longing night and day  To dream my very life away.  But dreams--of those who dream as I,  Aspiringly, are damned, and die:  Yet should I swear I mean alone,  By notes so very shrilly blown,  To break upon Time's monotone,  While yet my vapid joy and grief  Are tintless of the yellow leaf--  Why not an imp the greybeard hath,  Will shake his shadow in my path--  And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook  Connivingly my dreaming-book.       *       *       *       *       *                                 DOUBTFUL POEMS.       *       *       *       *       *ALONE.  From childhood's hour I have not been  As others were--I have not seen  As others saw--I could not bring  My passions from a common spring--  From the same source I have not taken  My sorrow--I could not awaken  My heart to joy at the same tone--  And all I loved--_I_ loved alone--  _Thou_--in my childhood--in the dawn  Of a most stormy life--was drawn  From every depth of good and ill  The mystery which binds me still--  From the torrent, or the fountain--  From the red cliff of the mountain--  From the sun that round me roll'd  In its autumn tint of gold--  From the lightning in the sky  As it passed me flying by--  From the thunder and the storm--  And the cloud that took the form  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)  Of a demon in my view.March 17, 1829.       *       *       *       *       *TO ISADORE.I.       Beneath the vine-clad eaves,             Whose shadows fall before             Thy lowly cottage door--         Under the lilac's tremulous leaves--         Within thy snowy clasped hand             The purple flowers it bore.         Last eve in dreams, I saw thee stand,         Like queenly nymph from Fairy-land--         Enchantress of the flowery wand,             Most beauteous Isadore!II.      And when I bade the dream             Upon thy spirit flee,             Thy violet eyes to me         Upturned, did overflowing seem         With the deep, untold delight             Of Love's serenity;         Thy classic brow, like lilies white         And pale as the Imperial Night         Upon her throne, with stars bedight,             Enthralled my soul to thee!III.     Ah! ever I behold             Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,             Blue as the languid skies         Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;         Now strangely clear thine image grows,             And olden memories         Are startled from their long repose         Like shadows on the silent snows         When suddenly the night-wind blows             Where quiet moonlight lies.IV.      Like music heard in dreams,             Like strains of harps unknown,             Of birds for ever flown,--         Audible as the voice of streams         That murmur in some leafy dell,             I hear thy gentlest tone,         And Silence cometh with her spell         Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,         When tremulous in dreams I tell             My love to thee alone!V.       In every valley heard,             Floating from tree to tree,             Less beautiful to me,         The music of the radiant bird,         Than artless accents such as thine             Whose echoes never flee!         Ah! how for thy sweet voice I pine:--         For uttered in thy tones benign         (Enchantress!) this rude name of mine             Doth seem a melody!       *       *       *       *       *THE VILLAGE STREET.  In these rapid, restless shadows,    Once I walked at eventide,  When a gentle, silent maiden,    Walked in beauty at my side.  She alone there walked beside me  All in beauty, like a bride.  Pallidly the moon was shining    On the dewy meadows nigh;  On the silvery, silent rivers,    On the mountains far and high,--  On the ocean's star-lit waters,    Where the winds a-weary die.  Slowly, silently we wandered    From the open cottage door,  Underneath the elm's long branches    To the pavement bending o'er;  Underneath the mossy willow    And the dying sycamore.  With the myriad stars in beauty    All bedight, the heavens were seen,  Radiant hopes were bright around me,    Like the light of stars serene;  Like the mellow midnight splendor    Of the Night's irradiate queen.  Audibly the elm-leaves whispered    Peaceful, pleasant melodies,  Like the distant murmured music    Of unquiet, lovely seas;  While the winds were hushed in slumber    In the fragrant flowers and trees.  Wondrous and unwonted beauty    Still adorning all did seem,  While I told my love in fables    'Neath the willows by the stream;  Would the heart have kept unspoken    Love that was its rarest dream!  Instantly away we wandered    In the shadowy twilight tide,  She, the silent, scornful maiden,    Walking calmly at my side,  With a step serene and stately,    All in beauty, all in pride.  Vacantly I walked beside her.    On the earth mine eyes were cast;  Swift and keen there came unto me    Bitter memories of the past--  On me, like the rain in Autumn    On the dead leaves, cold and fast.  Underneath the elms we parted,    By the lowly cottage door;  One brief word alone was uttered--    Never on our lips before;  And away I walked forlornly,  Broken-hearted evermore.  Slowly, silently I loitered,    Homeward, in the night, alone;  Sudden anguish bound my spirit,    That my youth had never known;  Wild unrest, like that which cometh    When the Night's first dream hath flown.  Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper    Mad, discordant melodies,  And keen melodies like shadows    Haunt the moaning willow trees,  And the sycamores with laughter    Mock me in the nightly breeze.  Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight    Through the sighing foliage streams;  And each morning, midnight shadow,    Shadow of my sorrow seems;  Strive, O heart, forget thine idol!    And, O soul, forget thy dreams!       *       *       *       *       *THE FOREST REVERIE.      'Tis said that when      The hands of men    Tamed this primeval wood,  And hoary trees with groans of wo,  Like warriors by an unknown foe,    Were in their strength subdued,      The virgin Earth      Gave instant birth    To springs that ne'er did flow--      That in the sun      Did rivulets run,  And all around rare flowers did blow--      The wild rose pale      Perfumed the gale,  And the queenly lily adown the dale      (Whom the sun and the dew      And the winds did woo),  With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.      So when in tears      The love of years    Is wasted like the snow,  And the fine fibrils of its life  By the rude wrong of instant strife    Are broken at a blow--      Within the heart      Do springs upstart    Of which it doth now know,      And strange, sweet dreams,      Like silent streams  That from new fountains overflow,      With the earlier tide      Of rivers glide  Deep in the heart whose hope has died--  Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--    Its ashes, whence will spring and grow      Sweet flowers, ere long,--    The rare and radiant flowers of song!       *       *       *       *       *NOTES.Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe,and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled \"Alone\"have the chief claim to our notice. 'Fac-simile' copies of this piecehad been in possession of the present editor some time previous to itspublication in 'Scribner's Magazine' for September 1875; but as proofsof the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming, he refrained frompublishing it as requested. The desired proofs have not yet beenadduced, and there is, at present, nothing but internal evidence toguide us. \"Alone\" is stated to have been written by Poe in the album ofa Baltimore lady (Mrs. Balderstone?), on March 17th, 1829, and the'fac-simile' given in 'Scribner's' is alleged to be of his handwriting.If the caligraphy be Poe's, it is different in all essential respectsfrom all the many specimens known to us, and strongly resembles that ofthe writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript, both of whichthe contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added.The lines, however, if not by Poe, are the most successful imitation ofhis early mannerisms yet made public, and, in the opinion of one wellqualified to speak, \"are not unworthy on the whole of the parentageclaimed for them.\"Whilst Edgar Poe was editor of the 'Broadway Journal', some lines \"ToIsadore\" appeared therein, and, like several of his known pieces, boreno signature. They were at once ascribed to Poe, and in order to satisfyquestioners, an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared, saying theywere by \"A. Ide, junior.\" Two previous poems had appeared in the'Broadway Journal' over the signature of \"A. M. Ide,\" and whoever wrotethem was also the author of the lines \"To Isadore.\" In order, doubtless,to give a show of variety, Poe was then publishing some of his knownworks in his journal over 'noms de plume', and as no other writingswhatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of \"A. M. Ide,\" itis not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection maybe by the author of \"The Raven.\" Having been published without his usualelaborate revision, Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under anassumed name. The three pieces are included in the present collection,so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to beby the author of \"The Raven.\"       *       *       *       *       *                              PROSE POEMS.       *       *       *       *       *THE ISLAND OF THE FAY.    \"Nullus enim locus sine genio est.\"    _Servius_.\"_La musique_,\" says Marmontel, in those \"Contes Moraux\"[1] which in allour translations we have insisted upon calling \"Moral Tales,\" as if inmockery of their spirit--\"_la musique est le seul des talens qui jouissede lui-meme: tous les autres veulent des temoins_.\" He here confoundsthe pleasure derivable from sweet sounds with the capacity for creatingthem. No more than any other _talent_, is that for music susceptible ofcomplete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate itsexercise; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces_effects_ which may be fully enjoyed in solitude. The idea which the_raconteur_ has either failed to entertain clearly, or has sacrificed inits expression to his national love of _point_, is doubtless the verytenable one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughlyestimated when we are exclusively alone. The proposition in this formwill be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake andfor its spiritual uses. But there is one pleasure still within the reachof fallen mortality, and perhaps only one, which owes even more thandoes music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion. I mean the happinessexperienced in the contemplation of natural scenery. In truth, the manwho would behold aright the glory of God upon earth must in solitudebehold that glory. To me at least the presence, not of human life only,but of life, in any other form than that of the green things which growupon the soil and are voiceless, is a stain upon the landscape, is atwar with the genius of the scene. I love, indeed, to regard the darkvalleys, and the gray rocks, and the waters that silently smile, and theforests that sigh in uneasy slumbers, and the proud watchful mountainsthat look down upon all,--I love to regard these as themselves but thecolossal members of one vast animate and sentient whole--a whole whoseform (that of the sphere) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all;whose path is among associate planets; whose meek handmaiden is themoon; whose mediate sovereign is the sun; whose life is eternity; whosethought is that of a god; whose enjoyment is knowledge; whose destiniesare lost in immensity; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with ourown cognizance of the _animalcul\u00e6_ which infest the brain, a being whichwe in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material, much in thesame manner as these _animalcul\u00e6_ must thus regard us.Our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on everyhand, notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the priesthood,that space, and therefore that bulk, is an important consideration inthe eyes of the Almighty. The cycles in which the stars move are thosebest adapted for the evolution, without collision, of the greatestpossible number of bodies. The forms of those bodies are accurately suchas within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount ofmatter; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodatea denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfacesotherwise arranged. Nor is it any argument against bulk being an objectwith God that space itself is infinite; for there may be an infinity ofmatter to fill it; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matterwith vitality is a principle--indeed, as far as our judgments extend,the _leading_ principle in the operations of Deity, it is scarcelylogical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute, where wedaily trace it, and not extending to those of the august. As we findcycle within cycle without end, yet all revolving around one far-distantcentre which is the Godhead, may we not analogically suppose, in thesame manner, life within life, the less within the greater, and allwithin the Spirit Divine? In short, we are madly erring throughself-esteem in believing man, in either his temporal or futuredestinies, to be of more moment in the universe than that vast \"clod ofthe valley\" which he tills and contemns, and to which he denies a soul,for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation[2].These fancies, and such as these, have always given to my meditationsamong the mountains and the forests, by the rivers and the ocean, atinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic.My wanderings amid such scenes have been many and far-searching, andoften solitary; and the interest with which I have strayed through manya dim deep valley, or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a brightlake, has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that I havestrayed and gazed _alone._ What flippant Frenchman [3] was it who said,in allusion to the well known work of Zimmermann, that _\"la solitude estune belle chose; mais il faut quelqu'un pour vous dire que la solitudeest une belle chose\"_? The epigram cannot be gainsaid; but the necessityis a thing that does not exist.It was during one of my lonely journeyings, amid a far distant region ofmountain locked within mountain, and sad rivers and melancholy tarnswrithing or sleeping within all, that I chanced upon a certain rivuletand island. I came upon them suddenly in the leafy June, and threwmyself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub,that I might doze as I contemplated the scene. I felt that thus onlyshould I look upon it, such was the character of phantasm which it wore.On all sides, save to the west where the sun was about sinking, arosethe verdant walls of the forest. The little river which turned sharplyin its course, and was thus immediately lost to sight, seemed to have noexit from its prison, but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage ofthe trees to the east; while in the opposite quarter (so it appeared tome as I lay at length and glanced upward) there poured down noiselesslyand continuously into the valley a rich golden and crimson waterfallfrom the sunset fountains of the sky.About midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in, onesmall circular island, profusely verdured, reposed upon the bosom of thestream.  So blended bank and shadow there,  That each seemed pendulous in air--so mirror-like was the glassy water, that it was scarcely possible tosay at what point upon the slope of the emerald turf its crystaldominion began. My position enabled me to include in a single view boththe eastern and western extremities of the islet, and I observed asingularly-marked difference in their aspects. The latter was all oneradiant harem of garden beauties. It glowed and blushed beneath the eyeof the slant sunlight, and fairly laughed with flowers. The grass wasshort, springy, sweet-scented, and Asphodel-interspersed. The trees werelithe, mirthful, erect, bright, slender, and graceful, of eastern figureand foliage, with bark smooth, glossy, and parti-colored. There seemed adeep sense of life and joy about all, and although no airs blew from outthe heavens, yet everything had motion through the gentle sweepings toand fro of innumerable butterflies, that might have been mistaken fortulips with wings [4].The other or eastern end of the isle was whelmed in the blackest shade.A sombre, yet beautiful and peaceful gloom, here pervaded all things.The trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude--wreathing themselves into sad, solemn, and spectral shapes, thatconveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death. The grass wore thedeep tint of the cypress, and the heads of its blades hung droopingly,and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks, lowand narrow, and not very long, that had the aspect of graves, but werenot, although over and all about them the rue and the rosemaryclambered. The shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water, andseemed to bury itself therein, impregnating the depths of the elementwith darkness. I fancied that each shadow, as the sun descended lowerand lower, separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth,and thus became absorbed by the stream, while other shadows issuedmomently from the trees, taking the place of their predecessors thusentombed.This idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it, and Ilost myself forthwith in reverie. \"If ever island were enchanted,\" saidI to myself, \"this is it. This is the haunt of the few gentle Fays whoremain from the wreck of the race. Are these green tombs theirs?--or dothey yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own? In dying,do they not rather waste away mournfully, rendering unto God little bylittle their existence, as these trees render up shadow after shadow,exhausting their substance unto dissolution? What the wasting tree is tothe water that imbibes its shade, growing thus blacker by what it preysupon, may not the life of the Fay be to the death which engulfs it?\"As I thus mused, with half-shut eyes, while the sun sank rapidly torest, and eddying currents careered round and round the island, bearingupon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of thesycamore, flakes which, in their multiform positions upon the water, aquick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased; while Ithus mused, it appeared to me that the form of one of those very Faysabout whom I had been pondering, made its way slowly into the darknessfrom out the light at the western end of the island. She stood erect ina singularly fragile canoe, and urged it with the mere phantom of anoar. While within the influence of the lingering sunbeams, her attitudeseemed indicative of joy, but sorrow deformed it as she passed withinthe shade. Slowly she glided along, and at length rounded the islet andre-entered the region of light. \"The revolution which has just been madeby the Fay,\" continued I musingly, \"is the cycle of the brief year ofher life. She has floated through her winter and through her summer. Sheis a year nearer unto death: for I did not fail to see that as she cameinto the shade, her shadow fell from her, and was swallowed up in thedark water, making its blackness more black.\"And again the boat appeared and the Fay, but about the attitude of thelatter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic joy.She floated again from out the light and into the gloom (which deepenedmomently), and again her shadow fell from her into the ebony water, andbecame absorbed into its blackness. And again and again she made thecircuit of the island (while the sun rushed down to his slumbers), andat each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person,while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct, and at eachpassage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade, which becamewhelmed in a shadow more black. But at length, when the sun had utterlydeparted, the Fay, now the mere ghost of her former self, wentdisconsolately with her boat into the region of the ebony flood, andthat she issued thence at all I cannot say, for darkness fell over allthings, and I beheld her magical figure no more.[Footnote 1: Moraux is here derived from _moeurs_, and its meaning is\"_fashionable_,\" or, more strictly, \"of manners.\"][Footnote 2: Speaking of the tides, Pomponius Mela, in his treatise,'De Sit\u00fb Orbis', says,  \"Either the world is a great animal, or,\" etc.][Footnote 3: Balzac, in substance; I do not remember the words.][Footnote 4:  \"Florem putares nare per liquidum \u00e6thera.\"'P. Commire'.]       *       *       *       *       *THE POWER OF WORDS.'Oinos.'  Pardon, Agathos, the weakness of a spirit new-fledged with  immortality!'Agathos.'  You have spoken nothing, my Oinos, for which pardon is to be demanded.  Not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition. For wisdom, ask of  the angels freely, that it may be given!'Oinos.'  But in this existence I dreamed that I should be at once cognizant of  all things, and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all.'Agathos.'  Ah, not in knowledge is happiness, but in the acquisition of  knowledge! In forever knowing, we are forever blessed; but to know  all, were the curse of a fiend.'Oinos.'  But does not The Most High know all?'Agathos'.  _That_ (since he is The Most Happy) must be still the _one_ thing  unknown even to HIM.'Oinos.'  But, since we grow hourly in knowledge, must not _at last_ all things  be known?'Agathos.'  Look down into the abysmal distances!--attempt to force the gaze down  the multitudinous vistas of the stars, as we sweep slowly through them  thus--and thus--and thus! Even the spiritual vision, is it not at all  points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe?--the  walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has  appeared to blend into unity?'Oinos'.  I clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream.'Agathos'.  There are no dreams in Aidenn--but it is here whispered that, of this  infinity of matter, the _sole_ purpose is to afford infinite springs  at which the soul may allay the thirst _to know_ which is forever  unquenchable within it--since to quench it would be to extinguish the  soul's self. Question me then, my Oinos, freely and without fear.  Come! we will leave to the left the loud harmony of the Pleiades, and  swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond Orion,  where, for pansies and violets, and heart's-ease, are the beds of the  triplicate and triple-tinted suns.'Oinos'.  And now, Agathos, as we proceed, instruct me!--speak to me in the  earth's familiar tones! I understand not what you hinted to me just  now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality, we were  accustomed to call Creation. Do you mean to say that the Creator is  not God?'Agathos'.  I mean to say that the Deity does not create.'Oinos'.  Explain!'Agathos'.  In the beginning only, he created. The seeming creatures which are now  throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only  be considered as the mediate or indirect, not as the direct or  immediate results of the Divine creative power.'Oinos.'  Among men, my Agathos, this idea would be considered heretical in the  extreme.'Agathos.'  Among the angels, my Oinos, it is seen to be simply true.'Oinos.'  I can comprehend you thus far--that certain operations of what we term  Nature, or the natural laws, will, under certain conditions, give rise  to that which has all the _appearance_ of creation. Shortly before the  final overthrow of the earth, there were, I well remember, many very  successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to  denominate the creation of animalcul\u00e6.'Agathos.'  The cases of which you speak were, in fact, instances of the secondary  creation, and of the _only_ species of creation which has ever been  since the first word spoke into existence the first law.'Oinos.'  Are not the starry worlds that, from the abyss of nonentity, burst  hourly forth into the heavens--are not these stars, Agathos, the  immediate handiwork of the King?'Agathos.'  Let me endeavor, my Oinos, to lead you, step by step, to the  conception I intend. You are well aware that, as no thought can  perish, so no act is without infinite result. We moved our hands, for  example, when we were dwellers on the earth, and in so doing we gave  vibration to the atmosphere which engirdled it. This vibration was  indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the  earth's air, which thenceforward, _and forever_, was actuated by the  one movement of the hand. This fact the mathematicians of our globe  well knew. They made the special effects, indeed, wrought in the fluid  by special impulses, the subject of exact calculation--so that it  became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given  extent would engirdle the orb, and impress (forever) every atom of the  atmosphere circumambient. Retrograding, they found no difficulty; from  a given effect, under given conditions, in determining the value of  the original impulse. Now the mathematicians who saw that the results  of any given impulse were absolutely endless--and who saw that a  portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency  of algebraic analysis--who saw, too, the facility of the  retrogradation--these men saw, at the same time, that this species of  analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite  progress--that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and  applicability, except within the intellect of him who advanced or  applied it. But at this point our mathematicians paused.'Oinos.'  And why, Agathos, should they have proceeded?'Agathos.'  Because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond. It was  deducible from what they knew, that to a being of infinite  understanding--one to whom the _perfection_ of the algebraic analysis  lay unfolded--there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse  given the air--and the ether through the air--to the remotest  consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time. It is indeed  demonstrable that every such impulse _given the air_, must _in the  end_ impress every individual thing that exists _within the  universe;_--and the being of infinite understanding--the being whom  we have imagined--might trace the remote undulations of the  impulse--trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all  particles of all matter--upward and onward forever in their  modifications of old forms--or, in other words, _in their creation of  new_--until he found them reflected--unimpressive _at last_--back from  the throne of the Godhead. And not only could such a being do this,  but at any epoch, should a given result be afforded him--should one of  these numberless comets, for example, be presented to his  inspection--he could have no difficulty in determining, by the  analytic retrogradation, to what original impulse it was due. This  power of retrogradation in its absolute fulness and perfection--this  faculty of referring at _all_ epochs, _all_ effects to _all_  causes--is of course the prerogative of the Deity alone--but in every  variety of degree, short of the absolute perfection, is the power  itself exercised by the whole host of the Angelic Intelligences.'Oinos'.  But you speak merely of impulses upon the air.'Agathos'.  In speaking of the air, I referred only to the earth: but the general  proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether--which, since it  pervades, and alone pervades all space, is thus the great medium of  _creation_.'Oinos'.  Then all motion, of whatever nature, creates?'Agathos'.  It must: but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all  motion is thought--and the source of all thought is--'Oinos'.  God.'Agathos'.  I have spoken to you, Oinos, as to a child, of the fair Earth which  lately perished--of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth.'Oinos'.  You did.'Agathos'.  And while I thus spoke, did there not cross your mind some thought of  the _physical power of words_? Is not every word an impulse on the  air?'Oinos'.  But why, Agathos, do you weep--and why, oh, why do your wings droop as  we hover above this fair star--which is the greenest and yet most  terrible of all we have encountered in our flight? Its brilliant  flowers look like a fairy dream--but its fierce volcanoes like the  passions of a turbulent heart.'Agathos'.  They _are_!--they _are_!--This wild star--it is now three centuries  since, with clasped hands, and with streaming eyes, at the feet of my  beloved--I spoke it--with a few passionate sentences--into birth. Its  brilliant flowers _are_ the dearest of all unfulfilled dreams, and its  raging volcanoes _are_ the passions of the most turbulent and  unhallowed of hearts!       *       *       *       *       *THE COLLOQUY OF MONOS AND UNA.  [Greek: Mellonta  sauta']  These things are in the future.  _Sophocles_--'Antig.''Una.'  \"Born again?\"'Monos.'  Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, \"born again.\" These were the words  upon whose mystical meaning I had so long pondered, rejecting the  explanations of the priesthood, until Death itself resolved for me the  secret.'Una.'  Death!'Monos.'  How strangely, sweet _Una_, you echo my words! I observe, too, a  vacillation in your step, a joyous inquietude in your eyes. You are  confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the Life Eternal.  Yes, it was of Death I spoke. And here how singularly sounds that word  which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts, throwing a mildew  upon all pleasures!'Una.'  Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts! How often, Monos, did  we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature! How mysteriously  did it act as a check to human bliss, saying unto it, \"thus far, and  no farther!\" That earnest mutual love, my own Monos, which burned  within our bosoms, how vainly did we flatter ourselves, feeling happy  in its first upspringing that our happiness would strengthen with its  strength! Alas, as it grew, so grew in our hearts the dread of that  evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever! Thus in time it  became painful to love. Hate would have been mercy then.'Monos'.  Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una--mine, mine forever now!'Una'.  But the memory of past sorrow, is it not present joy? I have much to  say yet of the things which have been. Above all, I burn to know the  incidents of your own passage through the dark Valley and Shadow.'Monos'.  And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her Monos in vain? I will  be minute in relating all, but at what point shall the weird narrative  begin?'Una'.  At what point?'Monos'.  You have said.'Una'.  Monos, I comprehend you. In Death we have both learned the propensity  of man to define the indefinable. I will not say, then, commence with  the moment of life's cessation--but commence with that sad, sad  instant when, the fever having abandoned you, you sank into a  breathless and motionless torpor, and I pressed down your pallid  eyelids with the passionate fingers of love.'Monos'.  One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general condition at this  epoch. You will remember that one or two of the wise among our  forefathers--wise in fact, although not in the world's esteem--had  ventured to doubt the propriety of the term \"improvement,\" as applied  to the progress of our civilization. There were periods in each of the  five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose  some vigorous intellect, boldly contending for those principles whose  truth appears now, to our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious  --principles which should have taught our race to submit to the  guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control. At  long intervals some master-minds appeared, looking upon each advance  in practical science as a retrogradation in the true utility.  Occasionally the poetic intellect--that intellect which we now feel to  have been the most exalted of all--since those truths which to us were  of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that  _analogy_ which speaks in proof-tones to the imagination alone, and to  the unaided reason bears no weight--occasionally did this poetic  intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of  the philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree  of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing, a distinct  intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition  of his soul. And these men--the poets--living and perishing amid the  scorn of the \"utilitarians\"--of rough pedants, who arrogated to  themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the  scorned--these men, the poets, pondered piningly, yet not unwisely,  upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our  enjoyments were keen--days when _mirth_ was a word unknown, so  solemnly deep-toned was happiness--holy, august, and blissful days,  blue rivers ran undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest  solitudes, primeval, odorous, and unexplored. Yet these noble  exceptions from the general misrule served but to strengthen it by  opposition. Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil  days. The great \"movement\"--that was the cant term--went on: a  diseased commotion, moral and physical. Art--the Arts--arose supreme,  and once enthroned, cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated  them to power. Man, because he could not but acknowledge the majesty  of Nature, fell into childish exultation at his acquired and  still-increasing dominion over her elements. Even while he stalked a  God in his own fancy, an infantine imbecility came over him. As might  be supposed from the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with  system, and with abstraction. He enwrapped himself in generalities.  Among other odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and  in the face of analogy and of God--in despite of the loud warning  voice of the laws of _gradation_ so visibly pervading all things in  Earth and Heaven--wild attempts at an omniprevalent Democracy were  made. Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,  Knowledge. Man could not both know and succumb. Meantime huge smoking  cities arose, innumerable. Green leaves shrank before the hot breath  of furnaces. The fair face of Nature was deformed as with the ravages  of some loathsome disease. And methinks, sweet Una, even our  slumbering sense of the forced and of the far-fetched might have  arrested us here. But now it appears that we had worked out our own  destruction in the perversion of our _taste_, or rather in the blind  neglect of its culture in the schools. For, in truth, it was at this  crisis that taste alone--that faculty which, holding a middle position  between the pure intellect and the moral sense, could never safely  have been disregarded--it was now that taste alone could have led us  gently back to Beauty, to Nature, and to Life. But alas for the pure  contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of Plato! Alas for the  [Greek: mousichae]  which he justly regarded as an all-sufficient  education for the soul! Alas for him and for it!--since both were most  desperately needed, when both were most entirely forgotten or despised  [1]. Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how  truly!--\"_Que tout notre raisonnement se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 c\u00e9der au  sentiment;_\" and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the  natural, had time permitted it, would have regained its old ascendency  over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools. But this thing was  not to be. Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge, the old  age of the world drew near. This the mass of mankind saw not, or,  living lustily although unhappily, affected not to see. But, for  myself, the Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as  the price of highest civilization. I had imbibed a prescience of our  Fate from comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria  the architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than  either, the turbulent mother of all Arts. In the history of these  regions I met with a ray from the Future. The individual  artificialities of the three latter were local diseases of the Earth,  and in their individual overthrows we had seen local remedies applied;  but for the infected world at large I could anticipate no regeneration  save in death. That man, as a race, should not become extinct, I saw  that he must be \"_born again._\"  And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,  daily, in dreams. Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of the  days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having  undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular  obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the  mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered at  length a fit dwelling-place for man:--for man the Death-purged--for  man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge  no more--for the redeemed, regenerated, blissful, and now immortal,  but still for the _material_, man.'Una'.  Well do I remember these conversations, dear Monos; but the epoch of  the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed, and as the  corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing. Men lived;  and died individually. You yourself sickened, and passed into the  grave; and thither your constant Una speedily followed you. And though  the century which has since elapsed, and whose conclusion brings up  together once more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience  of duration, yet my Monos, it was a century still.'Monos'.  Say, rather, a point in the vague infinity. Unquestionably, it was in  the Earth's dotage that I died. Wearied at heart with anxieties which  had their origin in the general turmoil and decay, I succumbed to the  fierce fever. After some few days of pain, and many of dreamy delirium  replete with ecstasy, the manifestations of which you mistook for  pain, while I longed but was impotent to undeceive you--after some  days there came upon me, as you have said, a breathless and motionless  torpor; and this was termed _Death_ by those who stood around me.  Words are vague things. My condition did not deprive me of sentience.  It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of  him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly, lying motionless and  fully prostrate in a mid-summer noon, begins to steal slowly back into  consciousness, through the mere sufficiency of his sleep, and without  being awakened by external disturbances.  I breathed no longer. The pulses were still. The heart had ceased to  beat. Volition had not departed, but was powerless. The senses were  unusually active, although eccentrically so--assuming often each  other's functions at random. The taste and the smell were inextricably  confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and intense. The  rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the  last, affected me with sweet fancies of flowers--fantastic flowers,  far more lovely than any of the old Earth, but whose prototypes we  have here blooming around us. The eye-lids, transparent and bloodless,  offered no complete impediment to vision. As volition was in abeyance,  the balls could not roll in their sockets--but all objects within the  range of the visual hemisphere were seen with more or less  distinctness; the rays which fell upon the external retina, or into  the corner of the eye, producing a more vivid effect than those which  struck the front or interior surface. Yet, in the former instance,  this effect was so far anomalous that I appreciated it only as  _sound_--sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting  themselves at my side were light or dark in shade--curved or angular  in outline. The hearing, at the same time, although excited in degree,  was not irregular in action--estimating real sounds with an  extravagance of precision, not less than of sensibility. Touch had  undergone a modification more peculiar. Its impressions were tardily  received, but pertinaciously retained, and resulted always in the  highest physical pleasure. Thus the pressure of your sweet fingers  upon my eyelids, at first only recognized through vision, at length,  long after their removal, filled my whole being with a sensual delight  immeasurable. I say with a sensual delight. _All_ my perceptions were  purely sensual. The materials furnished the passive brain by the  senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased  understanding. Of pain there was some little; of pleasure there was  much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all. Thus your wild sobs  floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were  appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft  musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no  intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while large and  constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a  heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy  alone. And this was in truth the _Death_ of which these bystanders  spoke reverently, in low whispers--you, sweet Una, gaspingly, with  loud cries.  They attired me for the coffin--three or four dark figures which  flitted busily to and fro. As these crossed the direct line of my  vision they affected me as _forms;_ but upon passing to my side their  images impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and, other  dismal expressions of terror, of horror, or of woe. You alone, habited  in a white robe, passed in all directions musically about.  The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed by a  vague uneasiness--an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real  sounds fall continuously within his ear--low distant bell-tones,  solemn, at long but equal intervals, and commingling with melancholy  dreams. Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort. It  oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight, and was  palpable. There was also a moaning sound, not unlike the distant  reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which, beginning with the  first twilight, had grown in strength with the darkness. Suddenly  lights were brought into the rooms, and this reverberation became  forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound,  but less dreary and less distinct. The ponderous oppression was in a  great measure relieved; and, issuing from the flame of each lamp (for  there were many), there flowed unbrokenly into my ears a strain of  melodious monotone. And when now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon  which I lay outstretched, you sat gently by my side, breathing odor  from your sweet lips, and pressing them upon my brow, there arose  tremulously within my bosom, and mingling with the merely physical  sensations which circumstances had called forth, a something akin to  sentiment itself--a feeling that, half appreciating, half responded  to your earnest love and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the  pulseless heart, and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and  faded quickly away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a  purely sensual pleasure as before.  And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there  appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect. In its  exercise I found a wild delight--yet a delight still physical,  inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part. Motion in the animal  frame had fully ceased. No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no  artery throbbed. But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain  _that_ of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence  even an indistinct conception. Let me term it a mental pendulous  pulsation. It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of  _Time_. By the absolute equalization of this movement--or of such as  this--had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves been adjusted.  By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel,  and of the watches of the attendants. Their tickings came sonorously  to my ears. The slightest deviations from the true proportion--and  these deviations were omniprevalent--affected me just as violations of  abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense. Although  no two of the timepieces in the chamber struck the individual seconds  accurately together, yet I had no difficulty in holding steadily in  mind the tones, and the respective momentary errors of each. And  this--this keen, perfect self-existing sentiment of _duration_--this  sentiment existing (as man could not possibly have conceived it to  exist) independently of any succession of events--this idea--this  sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of the rest, was the first  obvious and certain step of the intemporal soul upon the threshold of  the temporal eternity.  It was midnight; and you still sat by my side. All others had departed  from the chamber of Death. They had deposited me in the coffin. The  lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the tremulousness of the  monotonous strains. But suddenly these strains diminished in  distinctness and in volume. Finally they ceased. The perfume in my  nostrils died away. Forms affected my vision no longer. The oppression  of the Darkness uplifted itself from my bosom. A dull shot like that  of electricity pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of  the idea of contact. All of what man has termed sense was merged in  the sole consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of  duration. The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of  the deadly _Decay_.  Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and the  sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a lethargic  intuition. I appreciated the direful change now in operation upon the  flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence  of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt that you  sat by my side. So, too, when the noon of the second day came, I was  not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side,  which confined me within the coffin, which deposited me within the  hearse, which bore me to the grave, which lowered me within it, which  heaped heavily the mould upon me, and which thus left me, in blackness  and corruption, to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm.  And here in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose, there  rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul watched narrowly  each second as it flew, and, without effort, took record of its  flight--without effort and without object.  A year passed. The consciousness of _being_ had grown hourly more  indistinct, and that of mere _locality_ had in great measure usurped  its position. The idea of entity was becoming merged in that of  _place_. The narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the  body was now growing to be the body itself. At length, as often  happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is _Death_  imaged)--at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep  slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,  yet left him half enveloped in dreams--so to me, in the strict embrace  of the _Shadow_, came _that_ light which alone might have had power to  startle--the light of enduring _Love_. Men toiled at the grave in  which I lay darkling. They upthrew the damp earth. Upon my mouldering  bones there descended the coffin of Una. And now again all was void.  That nebulous light had been extinguished. That feeble thrill had  vibrated itself into quiescence. Many _lustra_ had supervened. Dust  had returned to dust. The worm had food no more. The sense of being  had at length utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead--  instead of all things, dominant and perpetual--the autocrats _Place_  and _Time._ For _that_ which _was not_--for that which had no  form--for that which had no thought--for that which had no  sentience--for that which was soundless, yet of which matter formed no  portion--for all this nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the  grave was still a home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.[Footnote 1:  \"It will be hard to discover a better [method of education] than that  which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this  may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and  _music_ for the soul.\"Repub. lib. 2.  \"For this reason is a musical education most essential; since it  causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most intimately into the soul,  taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it with _beauty_ and making  the man _beautiful-minded_. ... He will praise and admire _the  beautiful_, will receive it with joy into his soul, will feed upon it,  and _assimilate his own condition with it_.\"Ibid. lib. 3. Music had, however, among the Athenians, a far morecomprehensive signification than with us. It included not only theharmonies of time and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment andcreation, each in its widest sense. The study of _music_ was with them,in fact, the general cultivation of the taste--of that which recognizesthe beautiful--in contradistinction from reason, which deals only withthe true.]       *       *       *       *       *THE CONVERSATION OF EIROS AND CHARMION.  I will bring fire to thee.  _Euripides_.--'Androm'.'Eiros'.  Why do you call me Eiros?'Charmion'.  So henceforward will you always be called. You must forget, too, _my_  earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion.'Eiros'.  This is indeed no dream!'Charmion'.  Dreams are with us no more;--but of these mysteries anon. I rejoice to  see you looking life-like and rational. The film of the shadow has  already passed from off your eyes. Be of heart, and fear nothing. Your  allotted days of stupor have expired, and to-morrow I will myself  induct you into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence.'Eiros'.  True--I feel no stupor--none at all. The wild sickness and the  terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,  rushing, horrible sound, like the \"voice of many waters.\" Yet my  senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their perception  of _the new_.'Charmion'.  A few days will remove all this;--but I fully understand you, and  feel for you. It is now ten earthly years since I underwent what you  undergo--yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still. You have now  suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer in Aidenn.'Eiros'.  In Aidenn?'Charmion'.  In Aidenn.'Eiros'.  O God!--pity me, Charmion!--I am overburthened with the majesty of all  things--of the unknown now known--of the speculative Future merged in  the august and certain Present.'Charmion'.  Grapple not now with such thoughts. To-morrow we will speak of this.  Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the exercise  of simple memories. Look not around, nor forward--but back. I am  burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event  which threw you among us. Tell me of it. Let us converse of familiar  things, in the old familiar language of the world which has so  fearfully perished.'Eiros'.  Most fearfully, fearfully!--this is indeed no dream.'Charmion'.  Dreams are no more. Was I much mourned, my Eiros?'Eiros'.  Mourned, Charmion?--oh, deeply. To that last hour of all there hung a  cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household.'Charmion'.  And that last hour--speak of it. Remember that, beyond the naked fact  of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. When, coming out from among  mankind, I passed into Night through the Grave--at that period, if I  remember aright, the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly  unanticipated. But, indeed, I knew little of the speculative  philosophy of the day.'Eiros'.  The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely unanticipated; but  analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with  astronomers. I need scarce tell you, my friend, that, even when you  left us, men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy  writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as  having reference to the orb of the earth alone, But in regard to the  immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at fault from that  epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of  the terrors of flame. The very moderate density of these bodies had  been well established. They had been observed to pass among the  satellites of Jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration  either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets. We  had long regarded the wanderers as vapory creations of inconceivable  tenuity, and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our  substantial globe, even in the event of contact. But contact was not  in any degree dreaded; for the elements of all the comets were  accurately known. That among _them_ we should look for the agency of  the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an  inadmissible idea. But wonders and wild fancies had been of late days  strangely rife among mankind; and, although it was only with a few of  the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement  by astronomers of a _new_ comet, yet this announcement was generally  received with I know not what of agitation and mistrust.  The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and it  was at once conceded by all observers that its path, at perihelion  would bring it into very close proximity with the earth. There were  two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained  that a contact was inevitable. I cannot very well express to you the  effect of this intelligence upon the people. For a few short days they  would not believe an assertion which their intellect, so long employed  among worldly considerations, could not in any manner grasp. But the  truth of a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the  understanding of even the most stolid. Finally, all men saw that  astronomical knowledge lies not, and they awaited the comet. Its  approach was not at first seemingly rapid, nor was its appearance of  very unusual character. It was of a dull red, and had little  perceptible train. For seven or eight days we saw no material increase  in its apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.  Meantime, the ordinary affairs of men were discarded, and all interest  absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in  respect to the cometary nature. Even the grossly ignorant aroused  their sluggish capacities to such considerations. The learned _now_  gave their intellect--their soul--to no such points as the allaying of  fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory. They sought--they panted  for right views. They groaned for perfected knowledge. _Truth_ arose  in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise  bowed down and adored.  That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result  from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground  among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the  reason and the fancy of the crowd. It was demonstrated that the  density of the comet's _nucleus_ was far less than that of our rarest  gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the  satellites of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which  served greatly to allay terror. Theologists, with an earnestness  fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them  to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous  instance had been known. That the final destruction of the earth must  be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that  enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no fiery  nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in a  great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold.  It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in  regard to pestilences and wars--errors which were wont to prevail upon  every appearance of a comet--were now altogether unknown, as if by  some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition  from her throne. The feeblest intellect had derived vigor from  excessive interest.  What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate  question. The learned spoke of slight geological disturbances, of  probable alterations in climate, and consequently in vegetation; of  possible magnetic and electric influences. Many held that no visible  or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced. While such  discussions were going on, their subject gradually approached, growing  larger in apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre. Mankind  grew paler as it came. All human operations were suspended.  There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the  comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any  previously recorded visitation. The people now, dismissing any  lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the  certainty of evil. The chimerical aspect of their terror was gone. The  hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms.  A very few days suffered, however, to merge even such feelings in  sentiments more unendurable. We could no longer apply to the strange  orb any _accustomed_ thoughts. Its _historical_ attributes had  disappeared. It oppressed us with a hideous _novelty_ of emotion. We  saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an  incubus upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains. It had taken,  with unconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of  rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.  Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom. It was clear that we  were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived. We even  felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind. The  exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all  heavenly objects were plainly visible through it. Meantime, our  vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this  predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise. A wild  luxuriance of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every  vegetable thing.  Yet another day--and the evil was not altogether upon us. It was now  evident that its nucleus would first reach us. A wild change had come  over all men; and the first sense of _pain_ was the wild signal for  general lamentation and horror. The first sense of pain lay in a  rigorous construction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable  dryness of the skin. It could not be denied that our atmosphere was  radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the  possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were now the  topics of discussion. The result of investigation sent an electric  thrill of the intensest terror through the universal heart of man.  It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound  of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-one measures  of oxygen and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one hundred of the  atmosphere. Oxygen, which was the principle of combustion, and the  vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the support of animal  life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature.  Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal  life or flame. An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been  ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had  latterly experienced. It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,  which had engendered awe. What would be the result of a _total  extraction of the nitrogen_? A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,  omni-prevalent, immediate;--the entire fulfilment, in all their  minute and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring  denunciations of the prophecies of the Holy Book.  Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?  That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,  was now the source of the bitterness of despair. In its impalpable  gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.  Meantime a day again passed--bearing away with it the last shadow of  Hope. We gasped in the rapid modification of the air. The red blood  bounded tumultuously through its strict channels. A furious delirium  possessed all men; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the  threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud. But the nucleus  of the destroyer was now upon us;--even here in Aidenn I shudder while  I speak. Let me be brief--brief as the ruin that overwhelmed. For a  moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating  all things. Then--let us bow down, Charmion, before the excessive  majesty of the great God!--then, there came a shouting and pervading  sound, as if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent  mass of ether in which we existed, burst at once into a species of  intense flame, for whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat  even the angels in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.  Thus ended all.       *       *       *       *       *SHADOW.--A PARABLE.    Yea! though I walk through the valley of the _Shadow_.    'Psalm of David'.Ye who read are still among the living; but I who write shall have longsince gone my way into the region of shadows. For indeed strange thingsshall happen, and secret things be known, and many centuries shall passaway, ere these memorials be seen of men. And, when seen, there will besome to disbelieve and some to doubt, and yet a few who will find muchto ponder upon in the characters here graven with a stylus of iron.The year had been a year of terror, and of feeling more intense thanterror for which there is no name upon the earth. For many prodigies andsigns had taken place, and far and wide, over sea and land, the blackwings of the Pestilence were spread abroad. To those, nevertheless,cunning in the stars, it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspectof ill; and to me, the Greek Oinos, among others, it was evident thatnow had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and ninety-fourthyear when, at the entrance of Aries, the planet Jupiter is enjoined withthe red ring of the terrible Saturnus. The peculiar spirit of the skies,if I mistake not greatly, made itself manifest, not only in the physicalorb of the earth, but in the souls, imaginations, and meditations ofmankind.Over some flasks of the red Chian wine, within the walls of a noblehall, in a dim city called Ptolemais, we sat, at night, a company ofseven. And to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door ofbrass: and the door was fashioned by the artisan Corinnos, and, being ofrare workmanship, was fastened from within. Black draperies, likewise inthe gloomy room, shut out from our view the moon, the lurid stars, andthe peopleless streets--but the boding and the memory of Evil, theywould not be so excluded. There were things around us and about of whichI can render no distinct account--things material and spiritual--heaviness in the atmosphere--a sense of suffocation--anxiety--and, aboveall, that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience whenthe senses are keenly living and awake, and meanwhile the powers ofthought lie dormant. A dead weight hung upon us. It hung upon ourlimbs--upon the household furniture--upon the goblets from which wedrank; and all things were depressed, and borne down thereby--all thingssave only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel.Uprearing themselves in tall slender lines of light, they thus remainedburning all pallid and motionless; and in the mirror which their lustreformed upon the round table of ebony at which we sat each of us thereassembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance, and the unquietglare in the downcast eyes of his companions. Yet we laughed and weremerry in our proper way--which was hysterical; and sang the songs ofAnacreon--which are madness; and drank deeply--although the purple winereminded us of blood. For there was yet another tenant of our chamber inthe person of young Zoilus. Dead and at full length he lay,enshrouded;--the genius and the demon of the scene. Alas! he bore noportion in our mirth, save that his countenance, distorted with theplague, and his eyes in which Death had but half extinguished the fireof the pestilence, seemed to take such an interest in our merriment asthe dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die. Butalthough I, Oinos, felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me,still I forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of theirexpression, and gazing down steadily into the depths of the ebonymirror, sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son ofTeos. But gradually my songs they ceased, and their echoes, rolling afaroff among the sable draperies of the chamber, became weak, andundistinguishable, and so faded away. And lo! from among those sabledraperies, where the sounds of the song departed, there came forth adark and undefiled shadow--a shadow such as the moon, when low inheaven, might fashion from the figure of a man: but it was the shadowneither of man nor of God, nor of any familiar thing. And quiveringawhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full viewupon the surface of the door of brass. But the shadow was vague, andformless, and indefinite, and was the shadow neither of man norGod--neither God of Greece, nor God of Chald\u00e6a, nor any Egyptian God.And the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway, and under the arch of theentablature of the door and moved not, nor spoke any word, but therebecame stationary and remained. And the door whereupon the shadow restedwas, if I remember aright, over against the feet of the young Zoilusenshrouded. But we, the seven there assembled, having seen the shadow asit came out from among the draperies, dared not steadily behold it, butcast down our eyes, and gazed continually into the depths of the mirrorof ebony. And at length I, Oinos, speaking some low words, demanded ofthe shadow its dwelling and its appellation. And the shadow answered, \"Iam SHADOW, and my dwelling is near to the Catacombs of Ptolemais, andhard by those dim plains of Helusion which border upon the foulCharonian canal.\" And then did we, the seven, start from our seats inhorror, and stand trembling, and shuddering, and aghast: for the tonesin the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being, but of amultitude of beings, and varying in their cadences from syllable tosyllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the well remembered and familiaraccents of many thousand departed friends.       *       *       *       *       *SILENCE.--A FABLE.The mountain pinnacles slumber; valleys, crags, and caves _are silent_.\"LISTEN to _me_,\" said the Demon, as he placed his hand upon my head.\"The region of which I speak is a dreary region in Libya, by the bordersof the river Z\u00e4ire. And there is no quiet there, nor silence.\"The waters of the river have a saffron and sickly hue; and they flownot onward to the sea, but palpitate forever and forever beneath the redeye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion. For many mileson either side of the river's oozy bed is a pale desert of giganticwater-lilies. They sigh one unto the other in that solitude, and stretchtowards the heaven their long and ghastly necks, and nod to and frotheir everlasting heads. And there is an indistinct murmur which comethout from among them like the rushing of subterrene water. And they sighone unto the other.\"But there is a boundary to their realm--the boundary of the dark,horrible, lofty forest. There, like the waves about the Hebrides, thelow underwood is agitated continually. But there is no wind throughoutthe heaven. And the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither andthither with a crashing and mighty sound. And from their high summits,one by one, drop everlasting dews. And at the roots, strange poisonousflowers lie writhing in perturbed slumber. And overhead, with a rustlingand loud noise, the gray clouds rush westwardly forever until they roll,a cataract, over the fiery wall of the horizon. But there is no windthroughout the heaven. And by the shores of the river Z\u00e4ire there isneither quiet nor silence.\"It was night, and the rain fell; and, falling, it was rain, but, havingfallen, it was blood. And I stood in the morass among the tall lilies,and the rain fell upon my head--and the lilies sighed one unto the otherin the solemnity of their desolation.\"And, all at once, the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist, and wascrimson in color. And mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stoodby the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon. Andthe rock was gray and ghastly, and tall,--and the rock was gray. Uponits front were characters engraven in the stones; and I walked throughthe morass of water-lilies, until I came close unto the shore, that Imight read the characters upon the stone. But I could not decipher them.And I was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fullerred, and I turned and looked again upon the rock and upon thecharacters;--and the characters were DESOLATION.\"And I looked upwards, and there stood a man upon the summit of therock; and I hid myself among the water-lilies that I might discover theaction of the man. And the man was tall and stately in form, and wrappedup from his shoulders to his feet in the toga of old Rome. And theoutlines of his figure were indistinct--but his features were thefeatures of a deity; for the mantle of the night, and of the mist, andof the moon, and of the dew, had left uncovered the features of hisface. And his brow was lofty with thought, and his eye wild with care;and in the few furrows upon his cheek, I read the fables of sorrow, andweariness, and disgust with mankind, and a longing after solitude.\"And the man sat upon the rock, and leaned his head upon his hand, andlooked out upon the desolation. He looked down into the low unquietshrubbery, and up into the tall primeval trees, and up higher at therustling heaven, and into the crimson moon. And I lay close withinshelter of the lilies, and observed the actions of the man. And the mantrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon therock.\"And the man turned his attention from the heaven, and looked out uponthe dreary river Z\u00e4ire, and upon the yellow ghastly waters, and upon thepale legions of the water-lilies. And the man listened to the sighs ofthe water-lilies, and to the murmur that came up from among them. And Ilay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And theman trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon therock.\"Then I went down into the recesses of the morass, and waded afar inamong the wilderness of the lilies, and called unto the hippopotamiwhich dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass. And thehippopotami heard my call, and came, with the behemoth, unto the foot ofthe rock, and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon. And I layclose within my covert and observed the actions of the man. And the mantrembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, and he sat upon therock.\"Then I cursed the elements with the curse of tumult; and a frightfultempest gathered in the heaven, where before there had been no wind. Andthe heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest--and the rainbeat upon the head of the man--and the floods of the river camedown--and the river was tormented into foam--and the water-liliesshrieked within their beds--and the forest crumbled before the wind--andthe thunder rolled--and the lightning fell--and the rock rocked to itsfoundation. And I lay close within my covert and observed the actions ofthe man. And the man trembled in the solitude;--but the night waned, andhe sat upon the rock.\"Then I grew angry and cursed, with the curse of silence, the river, andthe lilies, and the wind, and the forest, and the heaven, and thethunder, and the sighs of the water-lilies. And they became accursed,and _were still._ And the moon ceased to totter up its pathway toheaven--and the thunder died away--and the lightning did not flash--andthe clouds hung motionless--and the waters sunk to their level andremained--and the trees ceased to rock--and the water-lilies sighed nomore--and the murmur was heard no longer from among them, nor any shadowof sound throughout the vast illimitable desert. And I looked upon thecharacters of the rock, and they were changed;--and the characters wereSILENCE.\"And mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man, and his countenancewas wan with terror. And, hurriedly, he raised his head from his hand,and stood forth upon the rock and listened. But there was no voicethroughout the vast illimitable desert, and the characters upon the rockwere SILENCE. And the man shuddered, and turned his face away, and fledafar off, in haste, so that I beheld him no more.\"...Now there are fine tales in the volumes of the Magi--in the iron-bound,melancholy volumes of the Magi. Therein, I say, are glorious historiesof the Heaven, and of the Earth, and of the mighty Sea--and of the Geniithat overruled the sea, and the earth, and the lofty heaven. There wasmuch lore, too, in the sayings which were said by the sybils; and holy,holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled aroundDodona--but, as Allah liveth, that fable which the demon told me as hesat by my side in the shadow of the tomb, I hold to be the mostwonderful of all! And as the Demon made an end of his story, he fellback within the cavity of the tomb and laughed. And I could not laughwith the Demon, and he cursed me because I could not laugh. And the lynxwhich dwelleth forever in the tomb, came out therefrom, and lay down atthe feet of the Demon, and looked at him steadily in the face.       *       *       *       *       *                                   ESSAYS.       *       *       *       *       *THE POETIC PRINCIPLE.In speaking of the Poetic Principle, I have no design to be eitherthorough or profound. While discussing very much at random theessentiality of what we call Poetry, my principal purpose will be tocite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poemswhich best suit my own taste, or which, upon my own fancy, have left themost definite impression. By \"minor poems\" I mean, of course, poems oflittle length. And here, in the beginning, permit me to say a few wordsin regard to a somewhat peculiar principle, which, whether rightfully orwrongfully, has always had its influence in my own critical estimate ofthe poem. I hold that a long poem does not exist. I maintain that thephrase, \"a long poem,\" is simply a flat contradiction in terms.I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch asit excites, by elevating the soul. The value of the poem is in the ratioof this elevating excitement. But all excitements are, through a psychalnecessity, transient. That degree of excitement which would entitle apoem to be so called at all, cannot be sustained throughout acomposition of any great length. After the lapse of half an hour, at thevery utmost, it flags--fails--a revulsion ensues--and then the poem is,in effect, and in fact, no longer such.There are, no doubt, many who have found difficulty in reconciling thecritical dictum that the \"Paradise Lost\" is to be devoutly admiredthroughout, with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it,during perusal, the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictumwould demand. This great work, in fact, is to be regarded as poeticalonly when, losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art,Unity, we view it merely as a series of minor poems. If, to preserve itsUnity--its totality of effect or impression--we read it (as would benecessary) at a single sitting, the result is but a constant alternationof excitement and depression. After a passage of what we feel to be truepoetry, there follows, inevitably, a passage of platitude which nocritical prejudgment can force us to admire; but if, upon completing thework, we read it again; omitting the first book--that is to say,commencing with the second--we shall be surprised at now finding thatadmirable which we before condemned--that damnable which we hadpreviously so much admired. It follows from all this that the ultimate,aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun, is anullity--and this is precisely the fact.In regard to the Iliad, we have, if not positive proof, at least verygood reason, for believing it intended as a series of lyrics; but,granting the epic intention, I can say only that the work is based in animperfect sense of Art. The modern epic is, of the supposititiousancient model, but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation. But the dayof these artistic anomalies is over. If, at any time, any very long poem_were_ popular in reality--which I doubt--it is at least clear that novery long poem will ever be popular again.That the extent of a poetical work is _ceteris paribus_, the measure ofits merit, seems undoubtedly, when we thus state it, a propositionsufficiently absurd--yet we are indebted for it to the QuarterlyReviews. Surely there can be nothing in mere _size_, abstractlyconsidered--there can be nothing in mere _bulk_, so far as a volume isconcerned, which has so continuously elicited admiration from thesesaturnine pamphlets! A mountain, to be sure, by the mere sentiment ofphysical magnitude which it conveys, _does_ impress us with a sense ofthe sublime--but no man is impressed after _this_ fashion by thematerial grandeur of even \"The Columbiad.\" Even the Quarterlies have notinstructed us to be so impressed by it. _As yet_, they have not_insisted_ on our estimating Lamartine by the cubic foot, or Pollock bythe pound--but what else are we to _infer_ from their continual pratingabout \"sustained effort\"? If, by \"sustained effort,\" any littlegentleman has accomplished an epic, let us frankly commend him for theeffort--if this indeed be a thing commendable--but let us forbearpraising the epic on the effort's account. It is to be hoped thai commonsense, in the time to come, will prefer deciding upon a work of Artrather by the impression it makes--by the effect it produces--than bythe time it took to impress the effect, or by the amount of \"sustainedeffort\" which had been found necessary in effecting the impression. Thefact is, that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another--norcan all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them. By and by, thisproposition, with many which I have been just urging, will be receivedas self-evident. In the meantime, by being generally condemned asfalsities, they will not be essentially damaged as truths.On the other hand, it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief.Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism. A _very_ short poem,while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid, never produces aprofound or enduring effect. There must be the steady pressing down ofthe stamp upon the wax. De B\u00e9ranger has wrought innumerable things,pungent and spirit-stirring, but in general they have been tooimponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention, andthus, as so many feathers of fancy, have been blown aloft only to bewhistled down the wind.A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing apoem, in keeping it out of the popular view, is afforded by thefollowing exquisite little Serenade:  I arise from dreams of thee    In the first sweet sleep of night  When the winds are breathing low,    And the stars are shining bright.  I arise from dreams of thee,    And a spirit in my feet  Has led me--who knows how?--    To thy chamber-window, sweet!  The wandering airs they faint    On the dark the silent stream--  The champak odors fail    Like sweet thoughts in a dream;  The nightingale's complaint,    It dies upon her heart,  As I must die on thine,    O, beloved as thou art!  O, lift me from the grass!    I die, I faint, I fail!  Let thy love in kisses rain    On my lips and eyelids pale.  My cheek is cold and white, alas!    My heart beats loud and fast:  O, press it close to thine again,    Where it will break at last!Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines, yet no less a poet thanShelley is their author. Their warm, yet delicate and etherealimagination will be appreciated by all, but by none so thoroughly as byhim who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe inthe aromatic air of a southern midsummer night.One of the finest poems by Willis, the very best in my opinion which hehas ever written, has no doubt, through this same defect of unduebrevity, been kept back from its proper position, not less in thecritical than in the popular view:  The shadows lay along Broadway,    'Twas near the twilight-tide--  And slowly there a lady fair    Was walking in her pride.  Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly    Walk'd spirits at her side.  Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,    And honor charm'd the air;  And all astir looked kind on her,    And called her good as fair--  For all God ever gave to her    She kept with chary care.  She kept with care her beauties rare    From lovers warm and true--  For heart was cold to all but gold,    And the rich came not to woo--  But honor'd well her charms to sell,    If priests the selling do.  Now walking there was one more fair--    A slight girl, lily-pale;  And she had unseen company    To make the spirit quail--  Twixt Want and Scorn she walk'd forlorn,    And nothing could avail.  No mercy now can clear her brow    From this world's peace to pray,  For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,    Her woman's heart gave way!--  But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven,    By man is cursed alway!In this composition we find it difficult to recognise the Willis who haswritten so many mere \"verses of society.\" The lines are not only richlyideal but full of energy, while they breathe an earnestness, an evidentsincerity of sentiment, for which we look in vain throughout all theother works of this author.While the epic mania, while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixityis indispensable, has for some years past been gradually dying out ofthe public mind, by mere dint of its own absurdity, we find it succeededby a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated, but one which, inthe brief period it has already endured, may be said to haveaccomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than allits other enemies combined. I allude to the heresy of _The Didactic_. Ithas been assumed, tacitly and avowedly, directly and indirectly, thatthe ultimate object of all Poetry is truth. Every poem, it is said,should inculcate a moral, and by this moral is the poetical merit of thework to be adjudged. We Americans especially have patronized this happyidea, and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full. Wehave taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem'ssake, and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be toconfess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity andforce:--but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves tolook into our own souls we should immediately there discover that underthe sun there neither exists nor _can_ exist any work more thoroughlydignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem _perse_, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, this poem writtensolely for the poem's sake.With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man,I would nevertheless limit, in some measure, its modes of inculcation. Iwould limit to enforce them. I would not enfeeble them by dissipation.The demands of Truth are severe. She has no sympathy with the myrtles.All _that_ which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all _that_with which _she_ has nothing whatever to do. It is but making her aflaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers. In enforcing atruth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language. We must besimple, precise, terse. We must be cool, calm, unimpassioned. In a word,we must be in that mood which, as nearly as possible, is the exactconverse of the poetical. _He_ must be blind indeed who does notperceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and thepoetical modes of inculcation. He must be theory-mad beyond redemptionwho, in spite of these differences, shall still persist in attempting toreconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth.Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obviousdistinctions, we have the Pure Intellect, Taste, and the Moral Sense. Iplace Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in themind it occupies. It holds intimate relations with either extreme; butfrom the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference thatAristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among thevirtues themselves. Nevertheless we find the _offices_ of the triomarked with a sufficient distinction. Just as the Intellect concernsitself with Truth, so Taste informs us of the Beautiful, while the MoralSense is regardful of Duty. Of this latter, while Conscience teaches theobligation, and Reason the expediency, Taste contents herself withdisplaying the charms, waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of herdeformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to theappropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to Beauty.An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly asense of the Beautiful. This it is which administers to his delight inthe manifold forms, and sounds, and odors, and sentiments amid which heexists. And just as the lily is repeated in the lake, or the eyes ofAmaryllis in the mirror, so is the mere oral or written repetition ofthese forms, and sounds, and colors, and odors, and sentiments aduplicate source of delight. But this mere repetition is not poetry. Hewho shall simply sing, with however glowing enthusiasm, or with howevervivid a truth of description, of the sights, and sounds, and odors, andcolors, and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind--he, Isay, has yet failed to prove his divine title. There is still asomething in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We havestill a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us thecrystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of man. It is atonce a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It isthe desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of theBeauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspiredby an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggleby multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time toattain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhapsappertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music,the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted intotears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excessof pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at ourinability to grasp _now_, wholly, here on earth, at once and forever,those divine and rapturous joys of which _through_ the poem, or_through_ the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses.The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness--this struggle, on thepart of souls fittingly constituted--has given to the world all _that_which it (the world) has ever been enabled at once to understand and _tofeel_ as poetic.The Poetic Sentiment, of course, may develop itself in various modes--inPainting, in Sculpture, in Architecture, in the Dance--very especiallyin Music--and very peculiarly, and with a wide field, in the compositionof the Landscape Garden. Our present theme, however, has regard only toits manifestation in words. And here let me speak briefly on the topicof rhythm. Contenting myself with the certainty that Music, in itsvarious modes of metre, rhythm, and rhyme, is of so vast a moment inPoetry as never to be wisely rejected--is so vitally important anadjunct, that he is simply silly who declines its assistance, I will notnow pause to maintain its absolute essentiality. It is in Music perhapsthat the soul most nearly attains the great end for which, when inspiredby the poetic Sentiment, it struggles--the creation of supernal Beauty.It _may_ be, indeed, that here this sublime end is, now and, then,attained in _fact._ We are often made to feel, with a shivering delight,that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which _cannot_ have beenunfamiliar to the angels. And thus there can be little doubt that in theunion of Poetry with Music in its popular sense, we shall find thewidest field for the Poetic development. The old Bards and Minnesingershad advantages which we do not possess--and Thomas Moore, singing hisown songs, was, in the most legitimate manner, perfecting them as poems.To recapitulate then:--I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as_The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty._ Its sole arbiter is Taste. With theIntellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations.Unless incidentally, it has no concern whatever either with Duty or withTruth.A few words, however, in explanation. _That_ pleasure which is at oncethe most pure, the most elevating, and the most intense, is derived, Imaintain, from the contemplation of the Beautiful. In the contemplationof Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurableelevation, or excitement _of the soul_, which we recognize as the PoeticSentiment, and which is so easily distinguished from Truth, which is thesatisfaction of the Reason, or from Passion, which is the excitement ofthe heart. I make Beauty, therefore--using the word as inclusive of thesublime--I make Beauty the province of the poem, simply because it is anobvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly aspossible from their causes:--no one as yet having been weak enough todeny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least _most readily_attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that theincitements of Passion, or the precepts of Duty, or even the lessons ofTruth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for theymay subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of thework: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down inproper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the realessence of the poem.I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for yourconsideration, than by the citation of the Pr\u00f6em to Longfellow's \"Waif\":  The day is done, and the darkness    Falls from the wings of Night,  As a feather is wafted downward    From an eagle in his flight.  I see the lights of the village    Gleam through the rain and the mist,  And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,    That my soul cannot resist;  A feeling of sadness and longing,    That is not akin to pain,  And resembles sorrow only    As the mist resembles the rain.  Come, read to me some poem,    Some simple and heartfelt lay,  That shall soothe this restless feeling,    And banish the thoughts of day.  Not from the grand old masters,    Not from the bards sublime,  Whose distant footsteps echo    Through the corridors of Time.  For, like strains of martial music,    Their mighty thoughts suggest  Life's endless toil and endeavor;    And to-night I long for rest.  Read from some humbler poet,    Whose songs gushed from his heart,  As showers from the clouds of summer,    Or tears from the eyelids start;  Who through long days of labor,    And nights devoid of ease,  Still heard in his soul the music    Of wonderful melodies.  Such songs have power to quiet    The restless pulse of care,  And come like the benediction    That follows after prayer.  Then read from the treasured volume    The poem of thy choice,  And lend to the rhyme of the poet    The beauty of thy voice.  And the night shall be filled with music,    And the cares that infest the day,  Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,    And as silently steal away.With no great range of imagination, these lines have been justly admiredfor their delicacy of expression. Some of the images are very effective.Nothing can be better than           --the bards sublime,    Whose distant footsteps echo  Down the corridors of Time.The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective. The poem on thewhole, however, is chiefly to be admired for the graceful _insouciance_of its metre, so well in accordance with the character of thesentiments, and especially for the _ease_ of the general manner. This\"ease\" or naturalness, in a literary style, it has long been the fashionto regard as ease in appearance alone--as a point of really difficultattainment. But not so:--a natural manner is difficult only to him whoshould never meddle with it--to the unnatural. It is but the result ofwriting with the understanding, or with the instinct, that _the tone_,in composition, should always be that which the mass of mankind wouldadopt--and must perpetually vary, of course, with the occasion. Theauthor who, after the fashion of _The North American Review_, should beupon _all_ occasions merely \"quiet,\" must necessarily upon _many_occasions be simply silly, or stupid; and has no more right to beconsidered \"easy\" or \"natural\" than a Cockney exquisite, or than thesleeping Beauty in the waxworks.Among the minor poems of Bryant, none has so much impressed me as theone which he entitles \"June.\" I quote only a portion of it:  There, through the long, long summer hours,    The golden light should lie,  And thick young herbs and groups of flowers    Stand in their beauty by.  The oriole should build and tell  His love-tale, close beside my cell;    The idle butterfly  Should rest him there, and there be heard  The housewife-bee and humming bird.  And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,    Come, from the village sent,  Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,    With fairy laughter blent?  And what if, in the evening light,  Betrothed lovers walk in sight    Of my low monument?  I would the lovely scene around  Might know no sadder sight nor sound.  I know, I know I should not see    The season's glorious show,  Nor would its brightness shine for me;    Nor its wild music flow;  But if, around my place of sleep,  The friends I love should come to weep,    They might not haste to go.  Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,  Should keep them lingering by my tomb.  These to their soften'd hearts should bear    The thought of what has been,  And speak of one who cannot share    The gladness of the scene;  Whose part in all the pomp that fills  The circuit of the summer hills,    Is--that his grave is green;  And deeply would their hearts rejoice  To hear again his living voice.The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous--nothing could be moremelodious. The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner. Theintense melancholy which seems to well up, perforce, to the surface ofall the poet's cheerful sayings about his grave, we find thrilling us tothe soul--while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill. Theimpression left is one of a pleasurable sadness. And if, in theremaining compositions which I shall introduce to you, there be more orless of a similar tone always apparent, let me remind you that (how orwhy we know not) this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connectedwith all the higher manifestations of true Beauty. It is, nevertheless,  A feeling of sadness and longing    That is not akin to pain,  And resembles sorrow only    As the mist resembles the rain.The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so fullof brilliancy and spirit as \"The Health\" of Edward Coote Pinkney:  I fill this cup to one made up    Of loveliness alone,  A woman, of her gentle sex    The seeming paragon;  To whom the better elements    And kindly stars have given  A form so fair, that like the air,    'Tis less of earth than heaven.  Her every tone is music's own,    Like those of morning birds,  And something more than melody    Dwells ever in her words;  The coinage of her heart are they,    And from her lips each flows  As one may see the burden'd bee    Forth issue from the rose.  Affections are as thoughts to her,    The measures of her hours;  Her feelings have the fragrancy,    The freshness of young flowers;  And lovely passions, changing oft,    So fill her, she appears  The image of themselves by turns,--    The idol of past years!  Of her bright face one glance will trace    A picture on the brain,  And of her voice in echoing hearts    A sound must long remain;  But memory, such as mine of her,    So very much endears,  When death is nigh my latest sigh    Will not be life's, but hers.  I fill'd this cup to one made up    Of loveliness alone,  A woman, of her gentle sex    The seeming paragon--  Her health! and would on earth there stood,    Some more of such a frame,  That life might be all poetry,    And weariness a name.It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have been born too far south.Had he been a New Englander, it is probable that he would have beenranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal whichhas so long controlled the destinies of American Letters, in conductingthe thing called 'The North American Review'. The poem just cited isespecially beautiful; but the poetic elevation which it induces we mustrefer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet's enthusiasm. We pardon hishyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered.It was by no means my design, however, to expatiate upon the _merits_of what I should read you. These will necessarily speak for themselves.Boccalina, in his 'Advertisements from Parnassus', tells us that Zoilusonce presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirablebook:--whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work. Hereplied that he only busied himself about the errors. On hearing this,Apollo, handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat, bade him pick out _allthe chaff_ for his reward.Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics--but I am by nomeans sure that the god was in the right. I am by no means certain thatthe true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood.Excellence, in a poem especially, may be considered in the light of anaxiom, which need only be properly _put_, to become self-evident. It is_not_ excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such:--and thus topoint out too particularly the merits of a work of Art, is to admit thatthey are _not_ merits altogether.Among the \"Melodies\" of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguishedcharacter as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out ofview. I allude to his lines beginning--\"Come, rest in this bosom.\" Theintense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything inByron. There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed thatembodies the _all in all_ of the divine passion of Love--a sentimentwhich, perhaps, has found its echo in more, and in more passionate,human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words:  Come, rest in this bosom, my own stricken deer,  Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;  Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,  And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.  Oh! what was love made for, if 'tis not the same  Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?  I know not, I ask not, if guilt's in that heart,  I but know that I love thee, whatever thou art.  Thou hast call'd me thy Angel in moments of bliss,  And thy Angel I'll be,'mid the horrors of this,--  Through the furnace, unshrinking, thy steps to pursue,  And shield thee, and save thee,--or perish there too!It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination, whilegranting him Fancy--a distinction originating with Coleridge--than whomno man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore. The fact is,that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his otherfaculties, and over the fancy of all other men, as to have induced, verynaturally, the idea that he is fanciful _only._ But never was there agreater mistake. Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet.In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem moreprofoundly--more weirdly _imaginative,_ in the best sense, than thelines commencing--\"I would I were by that dim lake\"--which are thecomposition of Thomas Moore. I regret that I am unable to remember them.One of the noblest--and, speaking of Fancy--one of the most singularlyfanciful of modern poets, was Thomas Hood. His \"Fair Ines\" had alwaysfor me an inexpressible charm:  O saw ye not fair Ines?    She's gone into the West,  To dazzle when the sun is down    And rob the world of rest  She took our daylight with her,    The smiles that we love best,  With morning blushes on her cheek,    And pearls upon her breast.  O turn again, fair Ines,    Before the fall of night,  For fear the moon should shine alone,    And stars unrivall'd bright;  And blessed will the lover be    That walks beneath their light,  And breathes the love against thy cheek    I dare not even write!  Would I had been, fair Ines,    That gallant cavalier,  Who rode so gaily by thy side,    And whisper'd thee so near!  Were there no bonny dames at home,    Or no true lovers here,  That he should cross the seas to win    The dearest of the dear?  I saw thee, lovely Ines,    Descend along the shore,  With bands of noble gentlemen,    And banners-waved before;  And gentle youth and maidens gay,    And snowy plumes they wore;  It would have been a beauteous dream,    If it had been no more!  Alas, alas, fair Ines,    She went away with song,  With Music waiting on her steps,    And shoutings of the throng;  But some were sad and felt no mirth,    But only Music's wrong,  In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell,    To her you've loved so long.  Farewell, farewell, fair Ines,    That vessel never bore  So fair a lady on its deck,    Nor danced so light before,--  Alas for pleasure on the sea,    And sorrow on the shore!  The smile that blest one lover's heart    Has broken many more!\"The Haunted House,\" by the same author, is one of the truest poems everwritten,--one of the truest, one of the most unexceptionable, one of themost thoroughly artistic, both in its theme and in its execution. It is,moreover, powerfully ideal--imaginative. I regret that its lengthrenders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture. In place of itpermit me to offer the universally appreciated \"Bridge of Sighs:\"  One more Unfortunate,  Weary of breath,  Rashly importunate  Gone to her death!  Take her up tenderly,  Lift her with care;--  Fashion'd so slenderly,  Young and so fair!  Look at her garments  Clinging like cerements;  Whilst the wave constantly  Drips from her clothing;  Take her up instantly,  Loving, not loathing.  Touch her not scornfully  Think of her mournfully,  Gently and humanly;  Not of the stains of her,  All that remains of her  Now is pure womanly.  Make no deep scrutiny  Into her mutiny  Rash and undutiful;  Past all dishonor,  Death has left on her  Only the beautiful.  Where the lamps quiver  So far in the river,  With many a light  From window and casement,  From garret to basement,  She stood, with amazement,  Houseless by night.  The bleak wind of March  Made her tremble and shiver;  But not the dark arch,  Or the black flowing river:  Mad from life's history,  Glad to death's mystery,  Swift to be hurl'd--  Anywhere, anywhere  Out of the world!  In she plunged boldly,  No matter how coldly  The rough river ran,--  Over the brink of it,  Picture it,--think of it,  Dissolute Man!  Lave in it, drink of it  Then, if you can!  Still, for all slips of hers,  One of Eve's family--  Wipe those poor lips of hers  Oozing so clammily,  Loop up her tresses  Escaped from the comb,  Her fair auburn tresses;  Whilst wonderment guesses  Where was her home?  Who was her father?  Who was her mother!  Had she a sister?  Had she a brother?  Or was there a dearer one  Still, and a nearer one  Yet, than all other?  Alas! for the rarity  Of Christian charity  Under the sun!  Oh! it was pitiful!  Near a whole city full,  Home she had none.  Sisterly, brotherly,  Fatherly, motherly,  Feelings had changed:  Love, by harsh evidence,  Thrown from its eminence;  Even God's providence  Seeming estranged.  Take her up tenderly;  Lift her with care;  Fashion'd so slenderly,  Young, and so fair!  Ere her limbs frigidly  Stiffen too rigidly,  Decently,--kindly,--  Smooth and compose them;  And her eyes, close them,  Staring so blindly!  Dreadfully staring  Through muddy impurity,  As when with the daring  Last look of despairing  Fixed on futurity.  Perishing gloomily,  Spurred by contumely,  Cold inhumanity,  Burning insanity,  Into her rest,--  Cross her hands humbly,  As if praying dumbly,  Over her breast!  Owning her weakness,  Her evil behavior,  And leaving, with meekness,  Her sins to her Saviour!The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos. Theversification, although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of thefantastic, is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity whichis the thesis of the poem.Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received fromthe critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves:  Though the day of my destiny's over,    And the star of my fate hath declined,  Thy soft heart refused to discover    The faults which so many could find;  Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,    It shrunk not to share it with me,  And the love which my spirit hath painted    It never hath found but in _thee._  Then when nature around me is smiling,    The last smile which answers to mine,  I do not believe it beguiling,    Because it reminds me of thine;  And when winds are at war with the ocean,    As the breasts I believed in with me,  If their billows excite an emotion,    It is that they bear me from _thee._  Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,    And its fragments are sunk in the wave,  Though I feel that my soul is delivered    To pain--it shall not be its slave.  There is many a pang to pursue me:    They may crush, but they shall not contemn--  They may torture, but shall not subdue me--    'Tis of _thee_ that I think--not of them.  Though human, thou didst not deceive me,    Though woman, thou didst not forsake,  Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,    Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,--  Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,    Though parted, it was not to fly,  Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,    Nor mute, that the world might belie.  Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,    Nor the war of the many with one--  If my soul was not fitted to prize it,    'Twas folly not sooner to shun:  And if dearly that error hath cost me,    And more than I once could foresee,  I have found that whatever it lost me,    It could not deprive me of _thee_.  From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,    Thus much I at least may recall,  It hath taught me that which I most cherished    Deserved to be dearest of all:  In the desert a fountain is springing,    In the wide waste there still is a tree,  And a bird in the solitude singing,    Which speaks to my spirit of _thee_.Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult, the versificationcould scarcely be improved. No nobler theme ever engaged the pen ofpoet. It is the soul-elevating idea that no man can consider himselfentitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains theunwavering love of woman.From Alfred Tennyson, although in perfect sincerity I regard him as thenoblest poet that ever lived, I have left myself time to cite only avery brief specimen. I call him, and _think_ him the noblest of poets,_not_ because the impressions he produces are at _all_ times the mostprofound--_not_ because the poetical excitement which he induces is at_all_ times the most intense--but because it is at all times the mostethereal--in other words, the most elevating and most pure. No poet isso little of the earth, earthy. What I am about to read is from his lastlong poem, \"The Princess:\"    Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,  Tears from the depth of some divine despair  Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,  In looking on the happy Autumn fields,  And thinking of the days that are no more.    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,  That brings our friends up from the underworld,  Sad as the last which reddens over one  That sinks with all we love below the verge;  So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns  The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds  To dying ears, when unto dying eyes  The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;  So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.    Dear as remember'd kisses after death,  And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd  On lips that are for others; deep as love,  Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;  O Death in Life, the days that are no more.Thus, although in a very cursory and imperfect manner, I have endeavoredto convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle. It has been mypurpose to suggest that, while this Principle itself is strictly andsimply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty, the manifestation ofthe Principle is always found in _an elevating excitement of the soul_,quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of theHeart, or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason. For inregard to passion, alas! its tendency is to degrade rather than toelevate the Soul. Love, on the contrary--Love--the true, the divineEros--the Uranian as distinguished from the Dionasan Venus--isunquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes. And inregard to Truth, if, to be sure, through the attainment of a truth weare led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before, weexperience at once the true poetical effect; but this effect isreferable to the harmony alone, and not in the least degree to the truthwhich merely served to render the harmony manifest.We shall reach, however, more immediately a distinct conception of whattrue Poetry is, by mere reference to a few of the simple elements whichinduce in the Poet himself the true poetical effect. He recognizes theambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine inHeaven, in the volutes of the flower, in the clustering of lowshrubberies, in the waving of the grain-fields, in the slanting of talleastern trees, in the blue distance of mountains, in the grouping ofclouds, in the twinkling of half-hidden brooks, in the gleaming ofsilver rivers, in the repose of sequestered lakes, in the star-mirroringdepths of lonely wells. He perceives it in the songs of birds, in theharp of \u00c6olus, in the sighing of the night-wind, in the repining voiceof the forest, in the surf that complains to the shore, in the freshbreath of the woods, in the scent of the violet, in the voluptuousperfume of the hyacinth, in the suggestive odor that comes to him ateventide from far-distant undiscovered islands, over dim oceans,illimitable and unexplored. He owns it in all noble thoughts, in allunworldly motives, in all holy impulses, in all chivalrous, generous,and self-sacrificing deeds. He feels it in the beauty of woman, in thegrace of her step, in the lustre of her eye, in the melody of her voice,in her soft laughter, in her sigh, in the harmony of the rustling of herrobes. He deeply feels it in her winning endearments, in her burningenthusiasms, in her gentle charities, in her meek and devotionalendurance, but above all, ah, far above all, he kneels to it, heworships it in the faith, in the purity, in the strength, in thealtogether divine majesty of her _love._Let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem, one verydifferent in character from any that I have before quoted. It is byMotherwell, and is called \"The Song of the Cavalier.\" With our modernand altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare,we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathizewith the sentiments, and thus to appreciate the real excellence of thepoem. To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soulof the old cavalier:  A steed! a steed! of matchless speede!    A sword of metal keene!  Al else to noble heartes is drosse--    Al else on earth is meane.  The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.    The rowleing of the drum,  The clangor of the trumpet lowde--    Be soundes from heaven that come.  And oh! the thundering presse of knightes,    When as their war-cryes welle,  May tole from heaven an angel bright,    And rowse a fiend from hell,  Then mounte! then mounte, brave gallants all,    And don your helmes amaine,  Deathe's couriers, Fame and Honor, call    Us to the field againe.  No shrewish teares shall fill your eye    When the sword-hilt's in our hand,--  Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe    For the fayrest of the land;  Let piping swaine, and craven wight,    Thus weepe and puling crye,  Our business is like men to fight,    And hero-like to die!       *       *       *       *       *THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPOSITION.Charles Dickens, in a note now lying before me, alluding to anexamination I once made of the mechanism of _Barnaby Rudge_, says--\"Bythe way, are you aware that Godwin wrote his _Caleb Williams_ backwards?He first involved his hero in a web of difficulties, forming the secondvolume, and then, for the first, cast about him for some mode ofaccounting for what had been done.\"I cannot think this the _precise_ mode of procedure on the part ofGodwin--and indeed what he himself acknowledges is not altogether inaccordance with Mr. Dickens's idea--but the author of _Caleb Williams_was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage derivable from atleast a somewhat similar process. Nothing is more clear than that everyplot, worth the name, must be elaborated to its _d\u00e9nouement_ beforeanything be attempted with the pen. It is only with the _d\u00e9nouement_constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air ofconsequence, or causation, by making the incidents, and especially thetone at all points, tend to the development of the intention.There is a radical error, I think, in the usual mode of constructing astory. Either history affords a thesis--or one is suggested by anincident of the day--or, at best, the author sets himself to work in thecombination of striking events to form merely the basis of hisnarrative---designing, generally, to fill in with description, dialogue,or autorial comment, whatever crevices of fact or action may, from pageto page, render themselves apparent.I prefer commencing with the consideration of an _effect._ Keepingoriginality _always_ in view--for he is false to himself who ventures todispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source ofinterest--I say to myself, in the first place, \"Of the innumerableeffects or impressions of which the heart, the intellect, or (moregenerally) the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the presentoccasion, select?\" Having chosen a novel first, and secondly, a vivideffect, I consider whether it can be best wrought by incident ortone--whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone, or the converse,or by peculiarity both of incident and tone--afterwards looking about me(or rather within) for such combinations of events or tone as shall bestaid me in the construction of the effect.I have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be writtenby any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step bystep, the processes by which any one of his compositions attained itsultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never been given tothe world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanityhas had more to do with the omission than any one other cause. Mostwriters--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that theycompose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and wouldpositively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes,at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the truepurposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses ofidea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-maturedfancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selectionsand rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word,at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, thestep-ladders and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, andthe black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred,constitute the properties of the literary _histrio._I am aware, on the other hand, that the case is by no means common, inwhich an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which hisconclusions have been attained. In general, suggestions, having arisenpell-mell, are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner.For my own part, I have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to,nor, at any time, the least difficulty in recalling to mind theprogressive steps of any of my compositions; and, since the interest ofan analysis, or reconstruction, such as I have considered a_desideratum_, is quite independent of any real or fancied interest inthe thing analyzed, it will not be regarded as a breach of decorum on mypart to show the _modus operandi_ by which some one of my own works wasput together. I select \"The Raven\" as most generally known. It is mydesign to render it manifest that no one point in its composition isreferrible either to accident or intuition--that the work proceeded,step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequenceof a mathematical problem.Let us dismiss, as irrelevant to the poem, _per se_, thecircumstance--or say the necessity--which, in the first place, gave riseto the intention of composing _a_ poem that should suit at once thepopular and the critical taste.We commence, then, with this intention.The initial consideration was that of extent. If any literary work istoo long to be read at one sitting, we must be content to dispense withthe immensely important effect derivable from unity of impression--for,if two sittings be required, the affairs of the world interfere, andeverything like totality is at once destroyed. But since, _ceterisparibus_, no poet can afford to dispense with _anything_ that mayadvance his design, it but remains to be seen whether there is, inextent, any advantage to counterbalance the loss of unity which attendsit. Here I say no, at once. What we term a long poem is, in fact, merelya succession of brief ones--that is to say, of brief poetical effects.It is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as itintensely excites, by elevating the soul; and all intense excitementsare, through a psychal necessity, brief. For this reason, at leastone-half of the \"Paradise Lost\" is essentially prose--a succession ofpoetical excitements interspersed, _inevitably_, with correspondingdepressions--the whole being deprived, through the extremeness of itslength, of the vastly important artistic element, totality, or unity ofeffect.It appears evident, then, that there is a distinct limit, as regardslength, to all works of literary art--the limit of a single sitting--andthat, although in certain classes of prose composition, such as_Robinson Crusoe_ (demanding no unity), this limit may be advantageouslyoverpassed, it can never properly be overpassed in a poem. Within thislimit, the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation toits merit--in other words, to the excitement or elevation--again, inother words, to the degree of the true poetical effect which it iscapable of inducing; for it is clear that the brevity must be in directratio of the intensity of the intended effect--this, with oneproviso--that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite forthe production of any effect at all.Holding in view these considerations, as well as that degree ofexcitement which I deemed not above the popular, while not below thecritical taste, I reached at once what I conceived the proper _length_for my intended poem--a length of about one hundred lines. It is, infact, a hundred and eight.My next thought concerned the choice of an impression, or effect, to beconveyed: and here I may as well observe that, throughout theconstruction, I kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work_universally_ appreciable. I should be carried too far out of myimmediate topic were I to demonstrate a point upon which I haverepeatedly insisted, and which, with the poetical, stands not in theslightest need of demonstration--the point, I mean, that Beauty is thesole legitimate province of the poem. A few words, however, inelucidation of my real meaning, which some of my friends have evinced adisposition to misrepresent. That pleasure which is at once the mostintense, the most elevating, and the most pure, is, I believe, found inthe contemplation of the beautiful. When, indeed, men speak of Beauty,they mean, precisely, not a quality, as is supposed, but an effect--theyrefer, in short, just to that intense and pure elevation of _soul_--_not_ of intellect, or of heart--upon which I have commented, andwhich is experienced in consequence of contemplating \"the beautiful.\"Now I designate Beauty as the province of the poem, merely because it isan obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring from directcauses--that objects should be attained through means best adapted fortheir attainment--no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that thepeculiar elevation alluded to is _most readily_ attained in the poem.Now the object Truth, or the satisfaction of the intellect, and theobject Passion, or the excitement of the heart, are, although attainableto a certain extent in poetry, far more readily attainable in prose.Truth, in fact, demands a precision, and Passion a _homeliness_ (thetruly passionate will comprehend me) which are absolutely antagonisticto that Beauty which, I maintain, is the excitement, or pleasurableelevation, of the soul. It by no means follows from anything here saidthat passion, or even truth, may not be introduced, and even profitablyintroduced, into a poem--for they may serve in elucidation, or aid thegeneral effect, as do discords in music, by contrast--but the trueartist will always contrive, first, to tone them into propersubservience to the predominant aim, and secondly, to enveil them, asfar as possible, in that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the essenceof the poem.Regarding, then, Beauty as my province, my next question referred to the_tone_ of its highest manifestation--and all experience has shown thatthis tone is one of _sadness_. Beauty of whatever kind, in its supremedevelopment, invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears. Melancholyis thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones.The length, the province, and the tone being thus determined, I betookmyself to ordinary induction, with the view of obtaining some artisticpiquancy which might serve me as a key-note in the construction of thepoem--some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn. In carefullythinking over all the usual artistic effects--or more properly _points_,in the theatrical sense--I did not fail to perceive immediately that noone had been so universally employed as that of the _refrain_. Theuniversality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsicvalue, and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis. Iconsidered it, however, with regard to its susceptibility ofimprovement, and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition. As commonlyused, the _refrain_, or burden, not only is limited to lyric verse, butdepends for its impression upon the force of monotone--both in sound andthought. The pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity--ofrepetition. I resolved to diversify, and so heighten the effect, byadhering in general to the monotone of sound, while I continually variedthat of thought: that is to say, I determined to produce continuouslynovel effects, by the variation _of the application_ of the_refrain_--the _refrain_ itself remaining, for the most part, unvaried.These points being settled, I next bethought me of the _nature_ of my_refrain_. Since its application was to be repeatedly varied, it wasclear that the _refrain_ itself must be brief, for there would have beenan insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application inany sentence of length. In proportion to the brevity of the sentencewould of course be the facility of the variation. This led me at once toa single word as the best _refrain_.The question now arose as to the _character_ of the word. Having made upmy mind to a _refrain_, the division of the poem into stanzas was ofcourse a corollary, the _refrain_ forming the close to each stanza. Thatsuch a close, to have force, must be sonorous and susceptible ofprotracted emphasis, admitted no doubt, and these considerationsinevitably led me to the long _o_ as the most sonorous vowel inconnection with _r_ as the most producible consonant.The sound of the _refrain_ being thus determined, it became necessary toselect a word embodying this sound, and at the same time in the fullestpossible keeping with that melancholy which I had predetermined as thetone of the poem. In such a search it would have been absolutelyimpossible to overlook the word \"Nevermore.\" In fact, it was the veryfirst which presented itself.The next _desideratum_ was a pretext for the continuous use of the oneword \"nevermore.\" In observing the difficulty which I at once found ininventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition,I did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from thepre-assumption that the word was to be so continuously or monotonouslyspoken by a _human_ being--I did not fail to perceive, in short, thatthe difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with theexercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word. Here,then, immediately arose the idea of a _non_-reasoning creature capableof speech; and very naturally, a parrot, in the first instance,suggested itself, but was superseded forthwith by a Raven as equallycapable of speech, and infinitely more in keeping with the intended_tone_.I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird ofill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word \"Nevermore\" at theconclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in lengthabout one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object_supremeness_ or perfection at all points, I asked myself--\"Of allmelancholy topics what, according to the _universal_ understanding ofmankind, is the _most_ melancholy?\" Death, was the obvious reply. \"Andwhen,\" I said, \"is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?\" Fromwhat I have already explained at some length, the answer here also isobvious--\"When it most closely allies itself to _Beauty_; the death,then, of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic inthe world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited forsuch topic are those of a bereaved lover.\"I had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceasedmistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word \"Nevermore.\" I hadto combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the_application_ of the word repeated, but the only intelligible mode ofsuch combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word inanswer to the queries of the lover. And here it was that I saw at oncethe opportunity afforded for the effect on which I had been depending,that is to say, the effect of the _variation of application_. I saw thatI could make the first query propounded by the lover--the first query towhich the Raven should reply \"Nevermore\"--that I could make this firstquery a commonplace one, the second less so, the third still less, andso on, until at length the lover, startled from his original_nonchalance_ by the melancholy character of the word itself, by itsfrequent repetition, and by a consideration of the ominous reputation ofthe fowl that uttered it, is at length excited to superstition, andwildly propounds queries of a far different character--queries whosesolution he has passionately at heart--propounds them half insuperstition and half in that species of despair which delights inself-torture--propounds them not altogether because he believes in theprophetic or demoniac character of the bird (which reason assures him ismerely repeating a lesson learned by rote), but because he experiences afrenzied pleasure in so modelling his questions as to receive from the_expected_ \"Nevermore\" the most delicious because the most intolerableof sorrow. Perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me, or, morestrictly, thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction, Ifirst established in mind the climax or concluding query--that query towhich \"Nevermore\" should be in the last place an answer--that query inreply to which this word \"Nevermore\" should involve the utmostconceivable amount of sorrow and despair.Here then the poem may be said to have its beginning, at the end whereall works of art should begin; for it was here at this point of mypreconsiderations that I first put pen to paper in the composition ofthe stanza:  \"Prophet,\" said I, \"thing of evil! prophet still if bird or devil!  By that heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore,  Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant Aidenn,  It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--  Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\"      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"I composed this stanza, at this point, first that, by establishing theclimax, I might the better vary and graduate, as regards seriousness,and importance the preceding queries of the lover, and secondly, that Imight definitely settle the rhythm, the metre, and the length andgeneral arrangement of the stanza, as well as graduate the stanzas whichwere to precede, so that none of them might surpass this in rhythmicaleffect. Had I been able in the subsequent composition to construct morevigorous stanzas, I should without scruple have purposely enfeebled themso as not to interfere with the climacteric effect.And here I may as well say a few words of the versification. My firstobject (as usual) was originality. The extent to which this has beenneglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things inthe world. Admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere_rhythm_, it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre andstanza are absolutely infinite; and yet, for _centuries, no man, inverse has ever done, or ever seemed to think of doing, an originalthing_. The fact is that originality (unless in minds of very unusualforce) is by no means a matter, as some suppose, of impulse orintuition. In general, to be found, it must be elaborately sought and,although a positive merit of the highest class, demands in itsattainment less of invention than negation.Of course I pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre ofthe \"Raven.\" The former is trochaic--the latter is octametreacatalectic, alternating with heptametre catalectic repeated in the_refrain_ of the fifth verse, and terminating with tetrametrecatalectic. Less pedantically, the feet employed throughout (trochees)consists of a long syllable followed by a short; the first line of thestanza consists of eight of these feet, the second of seven and a half(in effect two-thirds), the third of eight, the fourth of seven and ahalf, the fifth the same, the sixth three and a half. Now, each of theselines taken individually has been employed before, and what originalitythe \"Raven\" has, is in their _combinations into stanzas;_ nothing evenremotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted. Theeffect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual andsome altogether novel effects, arising from an extension of theapplication of the principles of rhyme and alliteration.The next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together thelover and the Raven--and the first branch of this consideration was the_locale_. For this the most natural suggestion might seem to be aforest, or the fields--but it has always appeared to me that a close_circumscription of space_ is absolutely necessary to the effect ofinsulated incident--it has the force of a frame to a picture. It has anindisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention, and, ofcourse, must not be confounded with mere unity of place.I determined, then, to place the lover in his chamber--in a chamberrendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it. Theroom is represented as richly furnished--this in mere pursuance of theideas I have already explained on the subject of Beauty, as the soletrue poetical thesis.The _locale_ being thus determined, I had now to introduce the bird--andthe thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable. Theidea of making the lover suppose, in the first instance, that theflapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter, is a \"tapping\" atthe door, originated in a wish to increase, by prolonging, the reader'scuriosity, and in a desire to admit the incidental effect arising fromthe lover's throwing open the door, finding all dark, and thenceadopting the half-fancy that it was the spirit of his mistress thatknocked.I made the night tempestuous, first to account for the Raven's seekingadmission, and secondly, for the effect of contrast with the (physical)serenity within the chamber.I made the bird alight on the bust of Pallas, also for the effect ofcontrast between the marble and the plumage--it being understood thatthe bust was absolutely _suggested_ by the bird--the bust of _Pallas_being chosen, first, as most in keeping with the scholarship of thelover, and, secondly, for the sonorousness of the word, Pallas, itself.About the middle of the poem, also, I have availed myself of the forceof contrast, with a view of deepening the ultimate impression. Forexample, an air of the fantastic--approaching as nearly to the ludicrousas was admissible--is given to the Raven's entrance. He comes in \"withmany a flirt and flutter.\"  Not the _least obeisance made he_--not a moment stopped or stayed he,  _But with mien of lord or lady_, perched above my chamber door.In the two stanzas which follow, the design is more obviously carriedout:  Then this ebony bird beguiling my _sad fancy_ into smiling  By the _grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore_,  \"Though thy _crest be shorn and shaven_, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no    craven,  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the nightly shore--  Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore?\"      Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"  Much I marvelled _this ungainly fowl_ to hear discourse so plainly,  Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;  For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being  _Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--  Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door_,      With such name as \"Nevermore.\"The effect of the d\u00e9nouement being thus provided for, I immediately dropthe fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness--this tonecommencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted, withthe line,  But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only, etc.From this epoch the lover no longer jests--no longer sees anything evenof the fantastic in the Raven's demeanor. He speaks of him as a \"grim,ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore,\" and feels the\"fiery eyes\" burning into his \"bosom's core.\" This revolution ofthought, or fancy, on the lover's part, is intended to induce a similarone on the part of the reader--to bring the mind into a proper frame forthe _d\u00e9nouement_--which is now brought about as rapidly and as_directly_ as possible.With the _d\u00e9nouement_ proper--with the Raven's reply, \"Nevermore,\" tothe lover's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in anotherworld--the poem, in its obvious phase, that of a simple narrative, maybe said to have its completion. So far, everything is within the limitsof the accountable--of the real. A raven having learned by rote thesingle word \"Nevermore,\" and having escaped from the custody of itsowner, is driven at midnight, through the violence of a storm, to seekadmission at a window from which a light still gleams--thechamber-window of a student, occupied half in pouring over a volume,half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased. The casement beingthrown open at the fluttering of the bird's wings, the bird itselfperches on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of thestudent, who, amused by the incident and the oddity of the visitor'sdemeanor, demands of it, in jest and with out looking for a reply, itsname. The Raven addressed, answers with its customary word,\"Nevermore\"--a word which finds immediate echo in the melancholy heartof the student, who, giving utterance aloud to certain thoughtssuggested by the occasion, is again startled by the fowl's repetition of\"Nevermore.\" The student now guesses the state of the case, but isimpelled, as I have before explained, by the human thirst forself-torture, and in part by superstition, to propound such queries tothe bird as will bring him, the lover, the most of the luxury of sorrowthrough the anticipated answer \"Nevermore.\" With the indulgence, to theextreme, of this self-torture, the narration, in what I have termed itsfirst or obvious phase, has a natural termination, and so far there hasbeen no overstepping of the limits of the real.But in subjects so handled, however skilfully, or with however vivid anarray of incident, there is always a certain hardness or nakedness whichrepels the artistical eye. Two things are invariably required--first,some amount of complexity, or more properly, adaptation; and, secondly,some amount of suggestiveness, some undercurrent, however indefinite ofmeaning. It is this latter, in especial, which imparts to a work of artso much of that _richness_ (to borrow from colloquy a forcible term)which we are too fond of confounding with _the ideal_. It is the_excess_ of the suggested meaning--it is the rendering this the upperinstead of the under current of theme--which turns into prose (and thatof the very flattest kind) the so-called poetry of the so-calledtranscendentalists.Holding these opinions, I added the two concluding stanzas of thepoem--their suggestiveness being thus made to pervade all the narrativewhich has preceded them. The undercurrent of meaning is rendered firstapparent in the lines:  \"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\"               Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore!\"It will be observed that the words, \"from out my heart,\" involve thefirst metaphorical expression in the poem. They, with the answer,\"Nevermore,\" dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has beenpreviously narrated. The reader begins now to regard the Raven asemblematical--but it is not until the very last line of the very laststanza, that the intention of making him emblematical of _Mournful andnever-ending Remembrance_ is permitted distinctly to be seen:  And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting  On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;  And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,  And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;  And my soul _from out that shadow_ that lies floating on the floor              Shall be lifted--nevermore!         *       *       *       *       *OLD ENGLISH POETRY. [1]It should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection withwhich we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed towhat is, in itself, a thing apart from poetry--we mean to the simplelove of the antique--and that, again, a third of even the proper _poeticsentiment_ inspired by their writings, should be ascribed to a factwhich, while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract, andwith the old British poems themselves, should not be looked upon as amerit appertaining to the authors of the poems. Almost every devoutadmirer of the old bards, if demanded his opinion of their productions,would mention vaguely, yet with perfect sincerity, a sense of dreamy,wild, indefinite, and he would perhaps say, indefinable delight; onbeing required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure, hewould be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in generalhandling. This quaintness is, in fact, a very powerful adjunct toideality, but in the case in question it arises independently of theauthor's will, and is altogether apart from his intention. Words andtheir rhythm have varied. Verses which affect us to-day with a vividdelight, and which delight, in many instances, may be traced to the onesource, quaintness, must have worn in the days of their construction avery commonplace air. This is, of course, no argument against the poems_now_--we mean it only as against the poets _then_. There is a growingdesire to overrate them. The old English muse was frank, guileless,sincere and although very learned, still learned without art. No generalerror evinces a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error ofsupposing Donne and Cowley metaphysical in the sense wherein Wordsworthand Coleridge are so. With the two former ethics were the end--with thetwo latter the means. The poet of the \"Creation\" wished, by highlyartificial verse, to inculcate what he supposed to be moral truth--thepoet of the \"Ancient Mariner\" to infuse the Poetic Sentiment throughchannels suggested by analysis. The one finished by complete failurewhat he commenced in the grossest misconception; the other, by a pathwhich could not possibly lead him astray, arrived at a triumph which isnot the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of themultitude. But in this view even the \"metaphysical verse\" of Cowley isbut evidence of the simplicity and single-heartedness of the man. And hewas in this but a type of his _school_--for we may as well designate inthis way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in thevolume before us, and throughout all of whom there runs a veryperceptible general character. They used little art in composition.Their writings sprang immediately from the soul--and partook intenselyof that soul's nature. Nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency ofthis _abandon_--to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind--but,again, so to mingle the greatest possible fire, force, delicacy, and allgood things, with the lowest possible bathos, baldness, and imbecility,as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mindin such a school will be found inferior to those results in one(_ceteris paribus_) more artificial.We cannot bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the \"Book ofGems\" are such as will impart to a poetical reader the clearest possibleidea of the beauty of the _school_--but if the intention had been merelyto show the school's character, the attempt might have been consideredsuccessful in the highest degree. There are long passages now before usof the most despicable trash, with no merit whatever beyond that oftheir antiquity. The criticisms of the editor do not particularly pleaseus. His enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false. Hisopinion, for example, of Sir Henry's Wotton's \"Verses on the Queen ofBohemia\"--that \"there are few finer things in our language,\" isuntenable and absurd.In such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes ofPoesy which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time.Here everything is art, nakedly, or but awkwardly concealed. Noprepossession for the mere antique (and in this case we can imagine noother prepossession) should induce us to dignify with the sacred name ofpoetry, a series, such as this, of elaborate and threadbare compliments,stitched, apparently, together, without fancy, without plausibility, andwithout even an attempt at adaptation.In common with all the world, we have been much delighted with \"TheShepherd's Hunting\" by Withers--a poem partaking, in a remarkabledegree, of the peculiarities of 'Il Penseroso'. Speaking of Poesy, theauthor says:  \"By the murmur of a spring,  Or the least boughs rustleling,  By a daisy whose leaves spread,  Shut when Titan goes to bed,  Or a shady bush or tree,  She could more infuse in me  Than all Nature's beauties con  In some other wiser man.  By her help I also now  Make this churlish place allow  Something that may sweeten gladness  In the very gall of sadness--  The dull loneness, the black shade,  That these hanging vaults have made  The strange music of the waves  Beating on these hollow caves,  This black den which rocks emboss,  Overgrown with eldest moss,  The rude portals that give light  More to terror than delight,  This my chamber of neglect  Walled about with disrespect;  From all these and this dull air  A fit object for despair,  She hath taught me by her might  To draw comfort and delight.\"But these lines, however good, do not bear with them much of the generalcharacter of the English antique. Something more of this will be foundin Corbet's \"Farewell to the Fairies!\" We copy a portion of Marvell's\"Maiden lamenting for her Fawn,\" which we prefer--not only as a specimenof the elder poets, but in itself as a beautiful poem, abounding inpathos, exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness--to anythingof its species:  \"It is a wondrous thing how fleet  'Twas on those little silver feet,  With what a pretty skipping grace  It oft would challenge me the race,  And when't had left me far away  'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;  For it was nimbler much than hinds,  And trod as if on the four winds.  I have a garden of my own,  But so with roses overgrown,  And lilies, that you would it guess  To be a little wilderness;  And all the spring-time of the year  It only loved to be there.  Among the beds of lilies I  Have sought it oft where it should lie,  Yet could not, till itself would rise,  Find it, although before mine eyes.  For in the flaxen lilies shade  It like a bank of lilies laid;  Upon the roses it would feed  Until its lips even seemed to bleed,  And then to me 'twould boldly trip,  And print those roses on my lip,  But all its chief delight was still  With roses thus itself to fill,  And its pure virgin limbs to fold  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,  Had it lived long, it would have been  Lilies without, roses within.\"How truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable! Itpervades all. It comes over the sweet melody of the words--over thegentleness and grace which we fancy in the little maiden herself--evenover the half-playful, half-petulant air with which she lingers on thebeauties and good qualities of her favorite--like the cool shadow of asummer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets, \"and all sweet flowers.\"The whole is redolent with poetry of a very lofty order. Every line isan idea conveying either the beauty and playfulness of the fawn, or theartlessness of the maiden, or her love, or her admiration, or her grief,or the fragrance and warmth and _appropriateness_ of the littlenest-like bed of lilies and roses which the fawn devoured as it lay uponthem, and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happylittle damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and rosy smile onher face. Consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought inthe few lines we have quoted--the _wonder_ of the little maiden at thefleetness of her favorite--the \"little silver feet\"--the fawnchallenging his mistress to a race with \"a pretty skipping grace,\"running on before, and then, with head turned back, awaiting herapproach only to fly from it again--can we not distinctly perceive allthese things? How exceedingly vigorous, too, is the line,  \"And trod as if on the four winds!\"a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of thespeaker and the four feet of the favorite, one for each wind. Thenconsider the garden of \"my own,\" so overgrown, entangled with roses andlilies, as to be \"a little wilderness\"--the fawn loving to be there, andthere \"only\"--the maiden seeking it \"where it _should_ lie\"--and notbeing able to distinguish it from the flowers until \"itself wouldrise\"--the lying among the lilies \"like a bank of lilies\"--the loving to\"fill itself with roses,\"  \"And its pure virgin limbs to fold  In whitest sheets of lilies cold,\"and these things being its \"chief\" delights--and then the pre-eminentbeauty and naturalness of the concluding lines, whose very hyperboleonly renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence,the artlessness, the enthusiasm, the passionate girl, and morepassionate admiration of the bereaved child:  \"Had it lived long, it would have been  Lilies without, roses within.\"[Footnote 1: \"The Book of Gems.\" Edited by S.

Ardemment je souhaitais le jour--vainement j'avais    cherch\u00e9 d'emprunter \u00e0 mes livres un sursis au chagrin--au chagrin    de la L\u00e9nore perdue--de la rare et rayonnante jeune fille que les    anges nomment L\u00e9nore:--de nom pour elle ici, non, jamais plus!_And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtainThrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door--Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--                                  This it is and nothing more.\"    _Et de la soie l'incertain et triste bruissement en chaque rideau    purpural me traversait--m'emplissait de fantastiques terreurs pas    senties encore: si bien que, pour calmer le battement de mon coeur,    je demeurais maintenant \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter \u00abC'est quelque visiteur qui sollicite    l'entr\u00e9e, \u00e0 la porte de ma chambre--quelque visiteur qui sollicite    l'entr\u00e9e, \u00e0 la porte de ma chambre; c'est cela et rien de plus.\u00bb_Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\"Sir,\" said I, \"or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,That I scarce was sure I heard you\"--here I opened wide the door:--                                 Darkness there and nothing more.    _Mon \u00e2me devint subitement plus forte et, n'h\u00e9sitant davantage    \u00abMonsieur, dis-je, ou Madame, j'implore v\u00e9ritablement votre pardon;    mais le fait est que je somnolais et vous v\u00eentes si doucement frapper,    et si faiblement vous v\u00eentes heurter, heurter \u00e0 la porte de ma chambre,    que j'\u00e9tais \u00e0 peine s\u00fbr de vous avoir entendu.\u00bb--Ici j'ouvris, grande,    la porte: les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres et rien de plus.\u00bb_Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \"Lenore!\"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \"Lenore!\"--                                  Merely this and nothing more.    _Loin dans l'ombre regardant, je me tins longtemps \u00e0 douter,    m'\u00e9tonner et craindre, \u00e0 r\u00eaver des r\u00eaves qu'aucun mortel n'avait os\u00e9    r\u00eaver encore; mais le silence ne se rompit point et la qui\u00e9tude ne    donna de signe: et le seul mot qui se dit, fut le mot chuchot\u00e9    \u00abL\u00e9nore!\u00bb Je le chuchotai--et un \u00e9cho murmura de retour le mot    \u00abL\u00e9nore!\u00bb--purement cela et rien de plus._Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder than before,\"Surely,\" said I, \"surely that is something at my window lattice;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore--Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;--                                  'Tis the wind and nothing more.\"    _Rentrant dans la chambre, toute mon \u00e2me en feu, j'entendis bient\u00f4t    un heurt en quelque sorte plus fort qu'auparavant. \u00abS\u00fbrement, dis-je,    s\u00fbrement c'est quelque chose \u00e0 la persienne de ma fen\u00eatre. Voyons    donc ce qu'il y a et explorons ce myst\u00e8re--que  mon coeur se calme    un moment et explore ce myst\u00e8re; c'est le vent et rien de plus.\u00bb_Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;But, with mien of lord and lady, perched above my chamber door--Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--                                  Perched and sat and nothing more.    _Au large je poussai le volet; quand, avec maints enjouement et    agitation d'ailes, entra un majestueux Corbeau des saints jours de    jadis. Il ne fit pas la moindre r\u00e9v\u00e9rence, il ne s'arr\u00eata ni n'h\u00e9sita    un instant: mais, avec une mine de lord ou de lady, se percha au-dessus    de la porte de ma chambre--se percha sur un buste de Pallas juste    au-dessus de la porte de ma chambre--se percha, si\u00e9gea et rien de plus._Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\" I said, \"art sure no craven,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore--Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"                                  Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    _Alors cet oiseau d'\u00e9b\u00e8ne induisant ma triste imagination au sourire,    par le grave et s\u00e9v\u00e8re d\u00e9corum de la contenance qu'il eut: \u00abQuoique    ta cr\u00eate soit chue et rase, non! dis-je, tu n'es pas pour s\u00fbr un    poltron, spectral, lugubre et ancien Corbeau, errant loin du rivage    de Nuit--dis-moi quel est ton nom seigneurial au rivage plutonien de    Nuit.\u00bb Le Corbeau dit: \u00abJamais plus.\u00bb_Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human beingEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door--Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,                                  With such a name as \"Nevermore.\"    _Je m'\u00e9merveillai fort d'entendre ce disgracieux volatile s'\u00e9noncer    aussi clairement, quoique sa r\u00e9ponse n'e\u00fbt que peu de sens et peu    d'\u00e0-propos; car on ne peut s'emp\u00eacher de convenir que nul homme vivant    n'e\u00fbt encore l'heur de voir un oiseau au-dessus de la porte de sa    chambre--un oiseau ou toute autre b\u00eate sur le buste sculpt\u00e9, au-dessus    de la porte de sa chambre, avec un nom tel que: \u00abJamais plus.\u00bb_But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke onlyThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered--Till I scarcely more than muttered, \"Other friends have flown before--On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.\"                                  Then the bird said, \"Nevermore.\"    _Mais le Corbeau, perch\u00e9 solitairement sur ce buste placide, parla    ce seul mot comme si, son \u00e2me, en ce seul mot, il la r\u00e9pandait. Je ne    prof\u00e9rai donc rien de plus: il n'agita donc pas de plume--jusqu'\u00e0 ce    que je fis \u00e0 peine davantage que marmotter \u00abD'autres amis d\u00e9j\u00e0 ont    pris leur vol--demain il me laissera comme mes Esp\u00e9rances d\u00e9j\u00e0 ont    pris leur vol.\u00bb Alors l'oiseau dit: \u00abJamais plus.\u00bb_Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"what it utters is its only stock and store,Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful DisasterFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore                                  Of 'Never--nevermore.'\"    _Tressaillant au calme rompu par une r\u00e9plique si bien parl\u00e9e: \u00abSans    doute dis-je, ce qu'il prof\u00e8re est tout son fonds et son bagage, pris    \u00e0 quelque malheureux ma\u00eetre que l'impitoyable D\u00e9sastre suivit de pr\u00e8s    et de tr\u00e8s-pr\u00e8s suivit jusqu'\u00e0 ce que ses chansons comportassent un    unique refrain; jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les chants fun\u00e8bres de son Esp\u00e9rance    comportassent le m\u00e9lancolique refrain de \u00abJamais--jamais plus.\u00bb_But the Raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linkingFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore                                  Meant in croaking \"Nevermore.\"    _Le Corbeau induisant toute ma triste \u00e2me encore au sourire, je    roulai soudain un si\u00e9ge \u00e0 coussins en face de l'oiseau et du buste et    de la porte; et m'enfon\u00e7ant dans le velours, je me pris \u00e0 encha\u00eener    songerie \u00e0 songerie, pensant \u00e0 ce que cet augural oiseau de jadis--\u00e0    ce que ce sombre, disgracieux, sinistre, maigre et augural oiseau de    jadis signifiait en croassant: \u00abJamais plus.\u00bb_This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressingTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease recliningOn the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,                                  _She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!    _Cela, je m'assis occup\u00e9 \u00e0 le conjecturer, mais n'adressant pas une    syllabe \u00e0 l'oiseau dont les yeux de feu br\u00fblaient, maintenant, au fond    de mon sein; cela et plus encore, je m'assis pour le deviner, ma t\u00eate    reposant \u00e0 l'aise sur la housse de velours des coussins que d\u00e9vorait    la lumi\u00e8re de la lampe, housse violette de velours d\u00e9vor\u00e9 par la    lumi\u00e8re de la lampe qu'_Elle_ ne pressera plus, ah! jamais plus._Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\"Wretch,\" I cried, \"thy God hath lent thee--by these angels he hath sent theeRespite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!\"                                  Quoth the Raven, \"Nevermore.\"    _L'air, me sembla-t-il, devint alors plus dense, parfum\u00e9 selon un    encensoir invisible balanc\u00e9 par les S\u00e9raphins dont le pied, dans sa    chute, tintait sur l'\u00e9toffe du parquet. \u00abMis\u00e9rable, m'\u00e9criai-je, ton    Dieu t'a pr\u00eat\u00e9--il t'a envoy\u00e9, par ces anges, le r\u00e9pit--le r\u00e9pit et    le n\u00e9penth\u00e8s dans ta m\u00e9moire de L\u00e9nore!
